And such were \n>some of you...\"  I Cor. 6:9-11.\n\nThe moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_\nin this.  I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of\nactivity that could be named by \"fornication\" or \"theft\" or \"coveting\" or\n\"reviling\" or \"drunkenness\" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may\nor may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very\nfact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at\nall \"clear\" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest\nin MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,\nwith all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated\nChristian discussion of ALL these areas.\n\nHomosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I\nknow) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and\nchild molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly\n\"harmless\" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --\nthat would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter\nyou cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that\nyou want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]\n\n\t\"'I am free to do anything,' you say.  Yes, but not everything\n\tis for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one\n\twill not let anything make free with me.\"  [1 Cor. 6:12]\n\nWhich is a restatement that we must have no other \"god\" before God.  A\ncommandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some\npeople are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.\nIt is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary\nargument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such\nbehavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers.\n\nI won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.\nFundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your\nassumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of\nlaws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of\nwhich Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine\nthem.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are \"moral\" and\nwhich ones are \"ritual.\"  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology\ncourse should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories\nin an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).\nAnd I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus\nfrom the \"ritual law\" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.\n\nI'm dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this\nmatter) about how \"repulsive\" and \"unnatural\" our acts are -- and what\ndo they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of\narbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating\ninsects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you\nsay that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part\nof the ritual law?\n\nFor those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\nbe \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\nit is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\ndetermine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the\nwhole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: \"No doubt I am free to do anything.\"\nBut Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,\nthe Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go\nthrough Leviticus and decide each \"command\" there on that basis, then\nyour own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this\ncontext, it is remarkably offensive to say:\n\n>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the\n>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.\n\nWell, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the\none that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously\n(though one can always find jokers) in \"defense\" of bestiality.  It is\nabsolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\nraise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\nadult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\nthan the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you\nare being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the\nworld.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not\nmine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in\nour culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing\nus as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means\nyou can think of to do so.\n\nJesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,\nthe central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to\nlove one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-\nians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get\nin return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.\n\nChristians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every\ncorner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same\nold verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never\neven read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with\nthe vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\nmanage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great\nemotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even\ntaking the trouble to find out what it is.\n\nSuch behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.\nWHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to\ncondemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN\nto BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?\nGod forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or\ncondemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in\ninsisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are\nSO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.\n\nWhy, for God's sake?\n\n\t\"For God did not send the Son into the world\n\tto condemn the world,\n\tbut that the world might be saved through him.\n\tWhoever believes in him is not condemned,\n\tbut whoever does not believe has already been condemned\n\tfor refusing to believe in the name of God's only Son.\n\tNow the judgment is this:\n\tthe light has come into the world,\n\tbut men have preferred darkness to light\n\tbecause their deeds were evil.\n\tFor everyone who practices wickedness\n\thates the light,\n\tand does not come near the light\n\tfor fear his deeds will be exposed.\n\tBut he who acts in truth\n\tcomes into the light,\n\tso that it may be sh0own\n\tthat his deeds are done in God.\"\tJohn 3:17-21\n\nFor long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from\nevil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and\nrejected.

The verses in question are Hosea\n2:5,7 & 10; Jeremiah 4:30, 22:20 & 22; Lamentations 1:19; and Ezekiel\n16:33, 36 &37 and 23:5, 9 & 22.\n\n\t[ Hosea seems to have originated this usage, which Jeremiah and\n\t  Ezekiel picked up;  Lamentations is dependent on, though not\n\t  likely written by, Jeremiah. ]\n\nThe \"erotic\" meaning (in its allegorical use, not at all literally) is\nevident.  So too in English, unless you complement it with a phrase like\n\"of the arts\" the word \"lover\" is going to have an overtone of sexual\nrelationship.  There is no surprise here, but it is worthwhile to see\nthat standard Greek usage *does* show up in the translations from the\nHebrew! :-)\n\nMore interestingly, and some confirmation of my guess that later Koine\nusage avoided the verb _erao:_ because of its homonymy to _ero:_ (say),\n_eromai_ (ask), there is an error in Codex Vaticanus (normally, a very\nvaluable witness) where a form of _erao:_ is used in a completely absurd\ncontext -- 2 Samuel 20:18, where the  meaning *must* be \"say.\"\n\nIn addition to the above (and the uses I have already mentioned in Proverbs),\nEsther 2:17 uses the verb in its most natural application, \n\n\tkai e:rasthe\" ho basileus Esthe:r  --  and the King loved Esther\n\nand, rather more interestingly, 1 Samuel 19:2 supplies a modest degree of\nsupport to the gay appraisal of the relationship of David and Jonathan:\n\n\tkai Io:nathan huios Saoul e:[i]reito ton Dauid sphodra\n\t-- and Jonathan, Saul's son, loved David intensely\n\n\t[ I'm using the bracketed [i] for io:ta subscript, which I\n\t  don't yet have a reasonable ASCII convention for. ]\n\n(The relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about\nthe \"historical\" facts, but just that a quasi-official translation of\nthe Hebrew text in the Hellenistic period makes no bones about using the\n\"erotic\" verb in this context.  Given the quite general usage of _agapao:_\nfor erotic senses, this need not mean anything \"more\" than _agapao:_ alone\nwould mean, but it DOES disambiguate the relationship, as far as this\ntranslator goes!)\n-- \nMichael L.

I don't know if it\nactually contains an english translation or not.)\n\n3] Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is:\n   \"The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in\n   Acts\", Eldon J Epp (Cambridge, 1966).\n\n4] The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the\nearly '80s.  (I can supply the reference if anyone's interested.)\n\n5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.  So if\nyou're interested in examining the differences in the long recension\nan excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in:\n   \"A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT\", Bruce Metzger (United Bible\n   Society, 1971).\n\nMetzger's book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of\nthe Greek NT.  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went\nbehind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in\nthe UBS3.  Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are\nincluded in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts).\n\nIn particular in the introduction to the section on Acts Metzger writes:\n   \"[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full\n   report (with an English translation) of the several additions and\n   other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ...\n   Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the\n   text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the\n   evidence that supports the divergent readings.\" (p 272).\n\n>I understand that one of the early codexes, Vaticanus and Siniaticus has\n>this version of Acts.

The longer version to which you refer is\nusually called the \"Western\" version and its main witness is the Codex\nBezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).\n\n7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark's edition\n(mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the\ntext edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains\n18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.\n\n8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations\nin the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The main\ndifference seems to \"expansion\" of detail in the Western text (or, if\nyou prefer \"contractions\" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seems\nto be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specific\ncases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.\n\n9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the\nmore authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anything\napproaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents\npurely the \"authentic\" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be\nexamined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the\nAlexandrian text is the \"better\" more often than not.\n\nN\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 145 (FN-TP)"}, {"text": "From: shellgate!llo@uu4.psi.com (Larry L.

Unfortunately\nthere are a number of possible definitions.  Starting from the \nbroadest, commonly used definitions are:\n\n  a historical definition\n  people who accept Christ as Lord and savior\n  a broad doctrinal definition\n  narrow doctrinal definitions\n\n1) By a historical definition I mean the sort of definition a secular\nhistorian would likely use.  This would include any group that\ndeveloped out of the Christian church, and continues within the same\nbroad culture.  E.g. some Unitarians would fail just about any\ndoctrinal test you could come up with.  Yet it's clear that that group\ndeveloped from Christianity, and people from very different\nbackgrounds (e.g. Hindus) would likely see them as part of\nChristianity.  This is not a definition most Christians like, but it's\nrelevant in some political and ethnic contexts.\n\n2) Accepting Christ as Lord and savior is a test used by many\nChristian groups for membership, e.g. the Southern Baptists and\nPresbyterian Church (USA).  I would qualify it by saying that what\nmost people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to Christ, so that\nsomeone who accepted Christ as one of many gods would not fit.  It's\nan attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not based\non technical doctrine.  By this definition, groups such as Arians\nwould be viewed as heretical Christians, but still Christians.  In the\nmodern context this would include Mormons, JW's, and \"oneness\nPentecostals\".  They would be viewed as heretical Christians, but\nstill Christian.  In practice I believe just about everyone who falls\ninto this category would accept the Apostle's Creed.\n\n3) The next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition,\nwhich includes all of the major strands of Christianity, but excludes\ngroups that are felt to be outside \"historic Christianity.\"  This is\nof course a slippery enterprise, since Catholics could argue that\nProtestants are outside historic Christianity, etc.  But I think the\nmost commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the\nNicene Creed and the Formula of Chalcedon.  The attempt is to\ncharacterize doctrines that all major strands of Christianity agree\nare key.  Obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement.  A\nMormon will regard the LDS church as a major strand, and thus will not\nwant to include anything that contradicts their beliefs.  But I think\nthis definition would have fairly broad acceptance.\n\n4) Finally, some people use definitions that I would say are limited\nto a specific Christian tradition.  E.g. some evangelicals only\nconsider someone Christian if he has had an evangelical-style\nconversion experience, and some I've even heard of groups that limit\nit to their specific church.\n\nI think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used.\nA lot is going to depend upon the purpose you're using it for.  If\nyou're using it descriptively, e.g. in history or anthropology, you'll\nprobably use definition 1 or 2.  If you're using it normatively, i.e.\nto say what you believe the Christian message is, you'll probably use\na definition like 3 or even 4.\n\n--clh]\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 8 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: Alan.Olsen@p17.f40.n105.z1.fidonet.org (Alan Olsen)\nSubject: After 2000 years, can we say that Christian Morality is\nLines: 29\n\n\nMC> Theory of Creationism: MY theistic view of the theory of\nMC> creationism, (there  are many others) is stated in Genesis\nMC> 1.

If you are surveying our individual\nphilosophies, fine, but that's not strictly atheism. Atheism is not\njust another, godless version of the theistic explanations for life,\nthe universe and everything.

But if you can contrive\nto control the action in dreams or do an OOBE, it seems like a morality applies.\n\nNow, there seem to be 3 alternatives:\n\n1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.  In this case no morality\napplies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene', that is, not trying\nto think about anything evil, or indulgining in overly sexy or violent\nthoughts.\n\n2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane')\nEvidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in\ncommon by more than one person.  A\nmark of objective fact is that >1 people report the same objective experience.\nIn this case, the same interpersonal morality/ethics applies in dreams and\nOOBEs as does in waking life.\n\n3) Like (2), but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have a\nreal existence, a different moral/ethics apply there, and no (or maybe \ndifferent) moral laws apply there.\n\nSo... There it is.

Dr. James DeYoung; #3]\n\nR. Scroggs\n\n     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and\nsuggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a\n\"Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic\nterminology.\"  The term is derived from Lev 18\"22 & 20:13 where the LXX\njuxtaposes the two words arsenos (\"male\") and koiten (\"bed\"), and represents\nthe Hebrew miskab zabar (\"lying with a male\").   Yet he believes that Paul did\nnot originate the term, but borrowed it from \"circles of Hellenistic Jews\nacquainted with rabbinic discussions\" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid\n\"contact with the usual Greek terminology\" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs\nobserves, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions\nof pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to\nnative-speaking Greeks (108).\n\n     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the\nobject of the second part, thus differing from Boswell's \"learned discussion\"\n(107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of \"one who lies with a\nmale\" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9),\nwhich Scroggs interprets as \"the effeminate call-boy,\" arsenokoitai is the\nactive partner \"who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress' or who hires him on\noccasion to satisfy his sexual desires\" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not\nrefer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic\nmodel of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he\naffirms (109).\n     This is Scrogg's interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The\ncombination of pornoi (\"fornicators\"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai (\"slave\ndealers\") refers to \"male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave\ndealers [who procure them]\" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of\npederasty \"which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual\npurposes, and the use of these boys by adult males\" (121).  Even \"serious\nminded pagan authors\" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these\ninstances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently\ngeneral condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. \nConsequently Paul \"Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind\" (122).\nWe cannot know what Paul would have said about the \"contemporary model of\nadult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships\" (122).\n\n     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical\nconcerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of\nvices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and\nfunction of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any\nrelationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually\nnonexistent.  He concludes that Paul \"does not care about any specific item in\nthe lists\" (104). \n\n     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary\nphenomenon of a \"catalogue of vices,\"  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are\n\"irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today\" (129).  The \"model\nin today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model\nattacked by the NT\" that \"Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not\nrelevant to today's debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational\ndiscussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify\nrefusal of ordination. . . \" (127).\n\n      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI\n\nD. Wright\n\n     In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have\ncome under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell's\nview is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out\nseveral shortcomings of Boswell's treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults\nBoswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev\n18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the \"Apostolic\nConstitutions,\"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). \nBoswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term\nderives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This\nis significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell's\nclaim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the\ngender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean \"a male who sleeps with\na male,\" making arseno- the object.\n\n     Wright also faults Boswell's claims regarding linguistic features of the\nterm, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that\ncompounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it\nas an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely\none of dialectical diversity: \"No semantic import attaches to the difference\nbetween the two forms\" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which\nthe second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its\nobject and where \"the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its\ngender\" (132). \n\n     It is with Boswell's treatment of the early church fathers that Wright\ntakes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. \nFor example, Aristides' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis,\nandrobaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male\nhomosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell's discussion.  Boswell fails to cite\nHippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the\nSyriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to\nthe Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34). \n\n     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in\nparallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the\ndominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this\nparallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia (\"adultery\"), porneia\n(\"fornication\"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris\n(136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the\nTen Commandments as \"You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis (\"you shall not commit\nadultery\"), ou paidophthoreseis (\"you shall not practice homosexuality with\nboys\"), you shall not steal. . .\" (150 n. 43).\n\n     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein (\"commit homosexuality\") exists in the\nSibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was\ncoined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by\nOr.Sib., book 2 (137-38).\n\n     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew\nupon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John\nthe Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of\nhomosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.\n\n     Wright next replies to Boswell's contention that the term would not be\nabsent \"from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted\n(140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to\nthe first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used\ndozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g.\nDidache) show no acquaintance with Paul's letters or deliberately avoid citing\nScripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). \n\n     Boswell's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright's attention\n(141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom,\nomitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a\nlong uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom\n1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom's infrequent use of the term.  Wright\nobserves that Boswell has \"signally failed to demonstrate any us of\narsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual\nactivity\" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature\nand the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly\nspecified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world. \n\n     Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim\nand I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning\n\"homosexual\" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of\nthe word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell's limited\nconclusion based on them.\n\n     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the\ncatalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed\nin late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of\nhomosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the\npart of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into\nbeing under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke \"generally of\nmale activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual\nengagement with paides\" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were\ninterchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).\n\n     In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning\nhomosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and\nothers who limit the term to \"active male prostitutes\" or pederasty are without\nsignificant support from linguistic and historical studies.  \n\n[Next: the questioning of Wrights position by William Peterson.  After that, we\nget into the \"good\" stuff of historical & linguistic studies.  THis will\ninclude \"Symposium\" by Plato.  If there is any doubt as to the modern\nunderstanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time of\nPaul, this will certainly clear things up.  Also we will review Paul's use of\nLev18-20 in the NT and how, as for him, 1) the Law was fulfilled, but not done\naway with, 2) Lev 18-20 was the universal and the following chapters the\ngeneral.  Those who put forth that the OT no longer holds true today in our\nculture, should stick around for this one.]\n___________________________\n13 R. Scroggs, THe New Testament and Homosexuality (Phil: 1983) 86, 107-8. \nIndependently we came to the same conclusion.  Apparently the connection is\nmade in E.A. Sophocles, Greek Lexicon of the Roman & Byzantine Periods (from\n146BC to AD 1100).\n14   See discussion, 101-4.  He says the same thing about Paul's language in\nRom 1:26-27 (128).  But this is doubtful.  See the more cautious words of P.\nZaas, \"I Cor 6.9ff: Was Homosexuality Condoned in the Corinthian Church? SBLASP\n17 (1979):205-12.  He observes that the words moixai, malakoi, and arsenokoitai\nwere part of Jewish anti-Gentile polemic.  Yet Paul's wors at the end of the\nvice list, \"and such were some of you,\" indicate that \"Paul is addressing real\nor potential abuses of his ethical message, not citing primitive tradition by\nrote\" (210).  Wright disputes Zaas' attempt to associate the term with idolatry\n(147).\n15  On Boswell's treatment of Rom 1:26-7, the article by R.B. Hays, \"Relations\nNatural and Unnatural\"  A Response to John Boswell's Exegesis of Romans 1,\" JRE\n14/1 (Spring 1986): 184-215, is an excellent critique.\n16  D.F. Wright, \"Homosexuals or Prostitutes?  The Meaning of ARSENOKOITAI (I\nCor 6:9, I Tim 1:10), VC 38 (1984):125-53.\n17  In an unpublished paper, Henry Mendell, \"ARSENOKOITAI: Boswell on Paul,\"\neffectively refutres Boswell's claims regarding the philology of arsenokoitai. \nHe finds the meaning to be general, \"a male who has sex with a male\" (4-11).  \n18  Wright's endnotes (148-49) list additional sources in the church fathers.\n19   We also have noticed the same tendency by Boswell to fail to cite all the\nreferences to Sodom and sodomy in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha.  See  J.B.\nDeYoung, \"A Critique of Prohomosexual Interpretations of the OT Apocrypha and\nPseudepigrapha,\" BSac 146/588 (1990):437-53.\n20   In light of the claim made by Boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitai\npoints to a meaning lacking homosexual significance, Wright asks pertinently\n\"why neither Philo nor Josephus use  paidofthoria, nor Josephus paiderastia,\nand why . . Clement did not use the latter and Chrysostom the former?\"  (152 n.\n71)  In a more recent article, \"Homosexuality: The Relevance of the Bible,\" EvQ\n61 (1989):291-300, Wright reiterates these same points.  Paul shows a\n\"remarkable originality\" in extending the OT ethic to the church (300).\n\n \n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 12 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: pww@spacsun.rice.edu (Peter Walker)\nSubject: Re: The Universe and Black Holes, was Re: 2000 years.....\nOrganization: I didn't do it, nobody saw me, you can't prove a thing.\nLines: 24\n\nIn article <1993Apr20.154658@IASTATE.EDU>, kv07@IASTATE.EDU (Warren\nVonroeschlaub) wrote:\n> \n>   Let's say that we drop a marble into the black hole.

Hislop's scholarship was\naccepted by the Bristish Oriental Institute which, at the time, was the premere\nInstitute for Oriental studies.  As I've stated over and over,  I've checked\nout about 25% of his references (most are now out of print or in private\nlibraries) and the likes of Wilkerson and Layard hold their own merit.  THey\ntoo came to the same conclusions and if you will trouble yourself, you will\nfind that their knowledge of the mysteries have yet to be surpassed.  Both were\nhighly honored by the British Oriental Museum.  Wilkerson is known as one of\nthe leading archeologist in the history of Egyptiology and Layard is still\nbeing refered two after 200 yrs of archeology in the Mesopotamian regions.  He\nwas recently refered to in a TIME article on Babylonian archeology.  \n\nPhony scholarship is when you review their references and find that they have\nmisquoted or misrepresented the conclusions.  Hislop did not.  His conclusions\ndo not tickle the ears, that much is self evident.  But to assert that his\nconclusions are \"spurious\" is without merit.  He gave references to all his\nconclusions and as I have stated, for the last 25 years I have used his\nconclusions in debates at RC seminaries and brotherhoods, not to mention the\nindividual priests and bishops that I have talked to one on one.  No counter to\nHislops scholarship was made.  The only rebuttals were against his conclusions\nbecause they do totally undermined the claims of the RCC. He was showing that\nthe intitution of the RCC was based on the mysteries (which others have shown\neven to this day in various articles and topics).  THe tongues movement in\nCorinth was a direct result of the mysteries entering into the church.  If it\nwas so in Corinth, why could they not have an influence in Rome, the city of\nseven hills?\n\nAlso, you do not have to listen to his conclusions, you can draw your own\nconclusions by looking at the customs, artifacts, the cerimonial dress, the\ndocrine of purgatory, etc from the vantage of the mysteries.  You don't even\nhave to be a believer to see the parallels.  Just one example.  THe mitre. \nWhere did it come from?  Why is it shaped the way it is?  What are the two\ntails that hang down the back represent?  Was this an ancient  head dress from\nan earlier culture and why was it in Rome at the time of the beginnings of the\nchurch of the State of Rome?  Does it have pagan history behind it, and if so,\nwhy did the RCC chose regardless?\n\nAny lay person of middle eastern religion can answer these questions.  Even the\nscriptures themselves refer to it.  All Hislop did was collect the information\nfrom all the various sources and put them in one binding.

In fact, there is substantial evidence\n(Skarda, 1985; Skarda & Freeman 1987) that brains work more or less\nchaotically, generating enough randomness for mental states to evolve.\nOur brains work much like genetic algorithm generators, I suppose.\n\n> the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered.

I suggest, however, that before trying to\nunderstand our consciousness as a collection of algorithms. \n\nKevin, take a look at the references I mentioned, and think again.\nI still think the best experts on the nature of a conscious mind\nare neurologists, neuropsychologists and biologists (but do not \nflame me for my opinions), since they study beings that are\nconscious. \n\nThe reason I am repeating my advice is that this discussion cannot\nlead to anywhere if our backgrounds are too different.\n\nAnd please, do not bring QM into this discussion at all - not\nall physicists are happy with the claim that our consciousness\nplays some special role in physics.

Presumably, the\n> materialist viewpoint is that it's the product of some kind of\n> chemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy +\n> different chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these?\n\nYou are still expecting that we could find the idea of 'green' in\nour brains somewhere, perhaps in the form of some chemical. This is\nnot how I see it. The sensation 'green' is a certain time-dependent\npattern in the area V4 of our visual cortex, and it is distributed\nwith the help of areas V1 and V2 to the rest of the brain. \n\nIndeed, a firing pattern. I have sometimes thought of our consciousness\nas a global free induction pattern of these local firing patterns,\nbut this is just idle speculation.\n\nScientific American's September 1992 issue was a special issue on\nmind and brain. Have you already read it from cover to cover? ;-)\nThere are two articles on visual perception, so you might be \ninterested.\n\nBut again, please note that subjective experiences cannot be \nobserved from a third-person perspective. If we see nothing but \nneuronal activity, we cannot go on to conclude that this is not the\nmind.\n\nKalat (1988) writes about numerous examples where electric stimulation\nof different areas of brain have led to various changes in the \npatients' state of mind. For instance, a patient whose septal area\nwas stimulated (without his knowledge) by remote control during\na psychiatric interview was quickly cured of his depression, and\nstarted discussing a plan to seduce his girlfriend.\n\nStimulations in the temporal lobe have sometimes led to embarrassing\nsituations, when the patients have started flirting with the\ntherapist.\n\nIn conclusion, there is evidence that\n\n1) brains are essentially necessary for subjective experiences, \n   brain damage is usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage\n\n2) conscious processes involve substantial brain activity in\n   various areas of brain - when we think of colours, our\n   visual cortex is activated etc.\n\n3) consciousness is an afterthought - we become conscious of our\n   actions with a half a second delay, and our brains are ahead\n   of our 'conscious will' by at least 350 ms. \n\nThus, I think it is fruitful to turn the question \"Why do 'I' see\ncolours\" around and ask \"What is this 'I' that seems to be \nobserving?\", since it seems that our conscious mind is not\nthe king of our brains.\n\n> If this is so, a\n> computer won't see colour, because the chemistry is different.

Does a neural\nnetwork that is capable of recognising handwritten numbers from\n0 to 9 see the numbers, if it is capable of sorting them?\n\nIf you are asking, \"why does an animal who is conscious of itself\nas an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal who\ndoesn't\", I have a good answer - read my previous posting,\nwhere I wrote why a sense of identity helps social animals to swap\nroles and act more morally, so that they don't unconsciously\nkill each other with newly discovered weapons. (A bit extreme,\nbut this is the basic idea.)\n\nWhen early _Homo_ became more and more efficient in using tools, \na sense of identity and the concept of 'self' had to evolve in\nline with this development. Indeed, respect for others and \nconscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantages\nfor social animals, such as early humans. \n\n> If I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction,\n> with two processes acting on it.

Thus, some atheism might result from \n>broken-ness.\n\nI'd like to field this one, if I may.  Although I am a believer in and follower\nof Christ, my experiences with religion haven't been all that positive.  In\nfact, there was one point in my life when, for about three days, I simply\n_couldn't_ believe in the existence of God.  Anyway, when I look back upon the\ntroubles I've had, they seem to fall into two categories -- impulses to\nunbelief that resulted from logical contradictions, and impulses to unbelief\nthat resulted from frustration with God.\n\nThe first category doesn't occur to me much anymore, as I have worked through\nmost of the arguments for the non-existence of God.  But way back when, these\nwould cause me some problems, and I would have to struggle with my faith to\ncontinue to believe.  I can see where others less stubborn than I (and I do\nmean stubborn.  Stubborness has often been the only thing standing between\nme an atheism from time to time) would fail.\n\nThe second category arises out of some long-term personal difficulties and\nthe struggle to live my life as God would have me live it WITHOUT living my \nlife as others would tell me how God would have me live it.  A good example of\nthis is my struggle with the more radical Christians I meet.  I am not, nor\nhave I ever been, \"on fire for Chirst,\" and I don't think I ever want to be.\nNevertheless, I am not \"lukewarm\" about my faith, so I don't really\nfit in with the mainstream either.  Quite naturally, I feel a lot of anxiety\nabout my dislocation within Christian society, and it can lead to a lot of\ninternal tension, when I want to do what I _know_ is right,\nbut when another part of me believes that what I want to do is wrong because\nall the other Christians think so to.  Quite naturally, this tension has a\ndestructive effect on my relationship with God, and during all of this internal\nstrife, there's atheism sitting there like the promised land -- no rules, no\nresponsibilities, no need to live up to anyone's expectations but my own.\nComplete freedom.  Of course, it's all an illusion, but nevertheless, it's a\nvery appealing illusion, especially when the so-called \"people of God\" are\nbehaving like total twits.  I can easily understand why someone would go\nthat route, and would be hostile to ever coming back.\n\nIMHO, many of the former-Christians-turned-atheists-who-are-now-actively-\nhostile-to-Christianity are so because their experience with Christ and God\nwasn't a very peaceful one, but one of mind-control and \"shut-up-and-do-what-\nyou're-told-because-we-know-what's-best-for-you-because-it's-God's-will-and-\nyou're-to-young-to-know-what-God's-will-is-yet\" courtesy of some of Christ's\nmore overzealous followers.  \n\nA final reason why people become atheists is because Christians do not have a\nvery good reputation right now.  One of the things that attracted people to\nChristianity in the ancient days was the love that Christians obviously had\nfor one another and the world around them.  Unlike the rest of the world,\nChristian communities actively cared for their poor, and the Christian rich\ndid not trod on the backs of their poorer brothers, but bent down to help\nthem.  Christians were known for living exemplary lives, even if they were\nthought to be traitors to the state because they wouldn't sacrifice to the\nemporer.  Nowadays, courtesy of the media and some Christian leaders who lost\nChrist on their way to power, people see Christians as sexually-repressed\nhippocritical busibodies who want to remake society into a facist version of \ntheir own moral view.\n\nThere are a lot more reasons why people become atheists, but I don't have time\nto go into them right now.\n\n\n\nTom Ault\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 417 (FN-TP)"}, {"text": "From: bill@twg.bc.ca (Bill Irwin)\nSubject: Re: What WAS the immaculate conception\nReply-To: bill@twg.bc.ca (Bill Irwin)\nOrganization: The Westrheim Group (TWG)\nLines: 53\n\nragraca@vela.acs.oakland.edu (Randy A.

A generation\nbefore the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh,\ngateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather\nthan God's way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which would\nhave given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored their\ndecision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the\nland of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision-\nmakers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and\ndestined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the\ntime they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderers\nhad been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with a\nsigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they\nwere going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence.\nWhatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached\nbones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression of\nhopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nation\nat Kadesh and had God' s promise of one day entering the land. The\nforty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, those\nwho were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the\ninheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Moses\nprays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over.\nAll these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining\npeople through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden.\nHis was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but\nhe also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem was\nthat they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. \"Who is your\nGod?\" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. When\nAaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or young\nbull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bull\nwho had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt's gods as He led\nIsrael to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles grow\nthin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and water\ngushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the\nGod of Almightiness becomes \"ho-hum --What' s next on the miracle menu?\"\nAnd a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He might\nbe all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a right\nto do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these people\nhad known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men's lives had hung\non the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believed\nGod could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIM\nand, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, His\nacts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From the\nday of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God.\nAt Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. He\nhad seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. This\nrequest was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God's glorious\nPerson. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and\nlovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word \"lovingkindness\" is not to be\nunderstood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationship\narising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as the\nlove that says, \"I will never leave you nor forsake you.\" Lovingkindness is as\ntenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its\nheels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based on\nfeelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and,\ntherefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God's love is not an emotion\nthat wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our\nhighest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. God\ndoes not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings\nof love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with\nus! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Him\nto reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- not\nbecause of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committed\nto us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He will\nnot let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us--\nbut a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It is\nsaying to the recipient, \"For as long as we shall live, I am for you.\"  The God\nwho has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--in\nHis coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who is\nlovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will never\nleave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him as\nlove; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeing\nmiracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in the\nheart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power.\nMoses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had for\nthese people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, they\ncould not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born out\nof knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One who\ngives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is to\nmiss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  If\nman is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on\nknowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues from\nlove demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years of\nmeaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to\nknow the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and the\npossibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. The\nlanguage Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its\nmother's love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It is\nwaking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for,\nprotected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we were\nto ask, \"What has the baby done to deserve this?\" or, \"Have arrangements\nbeen made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?\" Our\nquestions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child was\nconceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love's excitement, a love\nthat has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents' love is\nunconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child\nor its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally,\nspontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after\nHis image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the\nLord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to\nearn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identity\nthrough the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents' love. It is a\nscientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if\nit survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has been\nheld and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the\nembrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the new\ngeneration will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in\nthe love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and\ngladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His\nlove. \"Satisfied.\" in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing\nbeing filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describe\nthe earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received\nenough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be\ndrenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is the\nlifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in our\ndeepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems\ndisappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling\nthat he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make\nsense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks this\nsatisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the\nemotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in\nreligious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding\nto the love of the living God. Only in knowing God's love will the rest of life\nmake sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again\nbecame the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find it\nfascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His\nlove. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one would\nthink he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by\nthe knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knew\nbetter. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won't\nfind it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to\nmanipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and\ngive us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyes\nand satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking God\nto make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses' prayer was partially\nanswered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which\nworked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in its\nfullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out the\nlove of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church,\nwe read of the Holy Spirit \"falling upon\" the believers. This is an ancient\nexpression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used in\nLuke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and \"falling on his\nneck and kissing him.\" The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest\nself and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your\nbeing. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes.\nMoses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization\nthat we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taught\nus to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in a\nstate of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance\nand love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive love\nwe cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the Holy\nSpirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness to\nthink on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jaded\nwith the doctrine of \"perform to be accepted.\" We begin to realize that He\nloves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challenge\neveryone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your\neyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may not\nfeel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed the\nother day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians kept\nbehind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rays\nwithout being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing\nthat we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according to\nMoses, \"joy and gladness all our days.\" Joy is the result of a life that is\nfunctioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might say\nthat joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. Man' s highest\nperformance is to rest in the love God has for him... the hum will be joy, and\nthe result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now\nhas in life. Stop wandering in the wilderness. Be satisfied with His love and,\nin joy, day by day, receive all His promised blessings.\n\n\n----- End Included Message -----\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 18 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: mayne@pipe.cs.fsu.edu (William Mayne)\nSubject: Re: Christian Morality is\nOrganization: Florida State University Computer Science Department\nReply-To: mayne@cs.fsu.edu\nLines: 21\n\nIn article <4949@eastman.UUCP> dps@nasa.kodak.com writes:\n>\n>The fact is God could cause you to believe anything He wants you to. \n>But think about it for a minute.

M. Wilson\n   (London, 1923).\n\n2] Another work that might be useful is:\n   \"The Acts of the Apostles, a Critical Edition with Introduction and\n   Notes on Selected Passages\", Albert C. Clark (Oxford, 1933;\n   reprinted 1970).\n\n(This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the\ntext in Codex Bezae is the more authentic.  I don't know if it\nactually contains an english translation or not.)\n\n3] Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is:\n   \"The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in\n   Acts\", Eldon J Epp (Cambridge, 1966).\n\n4] The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the\nearly '80s.  (I can supply the reference if anyone's interested.)\n\n5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.  So if\nyou're interested in examining the differences in the long recension\nan excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in:\n   \"A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT\", Bruce Metzger (United Bible\n   Society, 1971).\n\nMetzger's book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of\nthe Greek NT.  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went\nbehind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in\nthe UBS3.  Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are\nincluded in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts).\n\nIn particular in the introduction to the section on Acts Metzger writes:\n   \"[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full\n   report (with an English translation) of the several additions and\n   other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ...\n   Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the\n   text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the\n   evidence that supports the divergent readings.\" (p 272).\n\n>I understand that one of the early codexes, Vaticanus and Siniaticus has\n>this version of Acts.  It would be interesting to know what the\n>differences are between the long and the short forms.\n\n6] Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have (including the\nones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter\n(or Alexandrian) version.  The longer version to which you refer is\nusually called the \"Western\" version and its main witness is the Codex\nBezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).\n\n7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark's edition\n(mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the\ntext edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains\n18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.\n\n8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations\nin the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The main\ndifference seems to \"expansion\" of detail in the Western text (or, if\nyou prefer \"contractions\" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seems\nto be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specific\ncases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.\n\n9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the\nmore authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anything\napproaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents\npurely the \"authentic\" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be\nexamined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the\nAlexandrian text is the \"better\" more often than not.\n\nN\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 506 (FN-TP)"}, {"text": "From: KEVXU@cunyvm.bitnet\nSubject: Re: Christianity and repeated lives\nOrganization: City University of New York\nLines: 36\n\nWhile this is essentially a discussion of reincarnation in the context of\nChristianity Gerry Palo has made some comparisons to Asian religious\nbeliefs on this topic which have simplified the Asian idea of karma\nto the point of misrepresentation.\n\nThere are significant differences in the idea of karma among Hindus,\nJains, Buddhists (and even among the various Buddhist traditions.)\n\nTo refer to karma as a system of reward for past deeds is totally\nincorrect in the Buddhist and Jain traditions.

I\nread his \"Satanic Bible\" a few years ago for a social studies project,\nas well as a book by Arthur Lyons called \"The Cult of Devil Worship\nin America.\"  The latter included a very interesting interview with\nthe Black Pope in which he did indeed say that Satan was merely an\ninstrument for one to realize the self.  \n\nWhen I refer to Satanism, I am referring to the mishmash of rural Satanic\nritualism and witchcraft which existed before the Church of Satan.  I\ndon't consider LaVey's church to be at all \"orthodox,\" nor do I consider\nits followers \"satanists.\"  LaVey combined the philosophies of Nietzsche,\nCrowley, and Reich, slapped in some religious doctrine, added a little\ntouch of P.T. Barnum, and christened his creation the Church of Satan.\nNo doubt the title was a calculated attempt to attract attention...I\nsuppose he could have just as easily called it the Church of Free Sex.\n\nAt any rate, it worked (for a while).  In its heyday, the Church had a\nhuge following, including such Hollywood celebrities as Sammy Davis, Jr.\nand Jayne Mansfield.

Bailey\n\n     D.S. Bailey was perhaps the trailblazer of new assessments of the meaning\nof arsenokoitai.  He takes the term in I Cor 6:9 as denoting males who actively\nengage in homosexual acts, in contrast to malakoi (\"effeminate\"), those who\nengage passively in such acts.*4   However, he insists that Paul knew nothing\nof \"inversion as an inherited trait, or an inherent condition due to\npsychological or glandular causes, and consequently regards all homosexual\npractice as evidence of perversion\" (38).  Hence Bailey limits the term's\nreference in Paul's works to acts alone and laments modern translations of the\nterm as \"homosexuals.\"  Bailey wants to distinguish between \"the homosexual\n*condition* (which is morally neutral) and homosexual *practices*\" [italics in\nsource].  Paul is precise in his terminology and Moffatt's translation\n\"sodomites\" best represents Paul's meaning in Bailey's judgment (39).  Bailey\nclearly denies that the homosexual condition was known by biblical writers.\n\nJ. Boswell\n\n     The most influential study of arsenokoitai among contemporary authors is\nthat of John Boswell.*5    Whereas the usual translation*6  of this term gives\nit either explicitly or implicitly an active sense, Boswell gives it a passive\nsense.\n\n      In an extended discussion of the term (341-53), he cites \"linguistic\nevidence and common sense\" to support his conclusion that the word means \"male\nsexual agents, i.e. active male prostitutes.\"  His argument is that the arseno-\npart of the word is adjectival, not the object of the koitai which refers to\nbase sexual activity.  Hence the term, according to Boswell, designates a male\nsexual person or male prostitute.  He acknowledges, however, that most\ninterpret the composite term as active, meaning \"those who sleep with, make\ntheir bed with, men.\"  Boswell bases his interpretation on linguistics and the\nhistorical setting.  He argues that in some compounds, such as paidomathes\n(\"child learner\"), the paido- is the subject of manthano, and in others, such\nas paidoporos (\"through which a child passes\"), the paido- is neither subject\nnor object but simply a modifier without verbal significance.  His point is\nthat each compound must be individually analyzed for its meaning.  More\ndirectly, he maintains that compounds with the Attic form arreno- employ it\nobjectively while those with the Hellenistic arseno- use it as an adjective\n(343).  Yet he admits exceptions to this distinction regarding arreno-.\n\n     Boswell next appeals to the Latin of the time, namely drauci or exoleti. \nThese were male prostitutes having men or women as their objects.  The Greek\narsenokoitai is the equivalent of the Latin drauci;  the corresponding passive\nwould be parakoitai (\"one who lies beside\"), Boswell affirms.  He claims that\narsenokoitai was the \"most explicit word available to Paul for a male\nprostitute,\" since by Paul's time the Attic words pornos (\"fornicator\") and\nporneuon (\"one committing fornication\"), found also in the LXX, had been\nadopted \"to refer to men who resorted to female prostitutes or simply committed\nfornication.\"*7\n\n     In the absence of the term from pagan writers such as Herodotus, Plato,\nAristotle, and Plutarch, and from the Jewish writers Philo and Josephus,\nBoswell finds even more convincing evidence for his affirmation that\narsenokoitai \"did not connote 'homosexual' or even 'sodomite' in the time of\nPaul\" (346).*8   He also demonstrates its absence in Pseudo-Lucian, Sextus\nEmpiricus, and Libanius.  He subsequently finds it lacking in \"all discussions\nof homosexual relation\" (346)*9  among Christian sources in Greek, including\nthe Didache, Tatian, Justin Martyr, Eusebius,*10    Clement of Alexandria,\nGregory of Nyssa, and John Chrysostom.  Chrysostom is singled out for his\nomission as \"final proof\" that the word could not mean homosexuality.*11 \n\n     Boswell next appeals to the omission of the texts of I Cor and I Tim from\ndiscussions of homosexuality among Latin church fathers (348).*12   Cited are\nTertullian, Arnobius, Lactantius, and Augustine.  The last named uses\n\"circumlocutions.\"  Other Latin writers include Ausonius, Cyprian, and Minucius\nFelix.  The term is also lacking in state and in church legislation.  By the\nsixth century the term became confused and was applied to a variety of sexual\nactivities from child molesting to anal intercourse between a husband and wife\n(353).\n\n     Having surveyed the sources, Boswell concludes, \n\n   There is no reason to believe that either arsenokoitai or malakoi connoted\n   homosexuality in the time of Paul or for centuries thereafter, and every\nreason\n   to suppose that, whatever they came to mean, they were not determinative of\n   Christian opinion on the morality of homosexual acts (353).\n\nIt is clear throughout that Boswell defines arsenokoitai to refer to male\nprostitutes.  He even goes so far as to conclude that Paul would probably not\ndisapprove of \"gay inclination,\"  \"gay relationships,\"  \"enduring love between\npersons of the same gender,\" or \"same-sex eroticism\"  (112, 166-17).\n\n\n________________________________________________________\n4.

I get a little queasy around the phrase \"aren't morally \nresponsible\", perhaps because I've heard it misused so many times.\n(I remember in college some folk trying to argue that a person who\nwas drunk was not morally responsible for his actions.) In general,\nmost folk can't control their dreams, but perhaps what you do all day\nand think about has some impact on them, hm? And I'm not sure what\n\"actions\" are in a dream. But I will note that Jesus does seem adamant\nabout the fact that our thought-life is at least as important as\nour actions.

I'll note that the Bible\ndoesn't talk much about dreams outside of the realm of God using them to speak\nto us, with the caveat that such messages are not always very clear, as it\nwarns somewhere in the OT. Given that, I would not give them a lot of\nattention unless you feel your dreams are trying to tell you something.\n\nI would discount talk of \"alternate planes,\" though.

I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of\nactivity that could be named by \"fornication\" or \"theft\" or \"coveting\" or\n\"reviling\" or \"drunkenness\" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may\nor may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very\nfact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at\nall \"clear\" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest\nin MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,\nwith all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated\nChristian discussion of ALL these areas.\n\nHomosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I\nknow) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and\nchild molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly\n\"harmless\" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --\nthat would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter\nyou cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that\nyou want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]\n\n\t\"'I am free to do anything,' you say.  Yes, but not everything\n\tis for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one\n\twill not let anything make free with me.\"  [1 Cor. 6:12]\n\nWhich is a restatement that we must have no other \"god\" before God.  A\ncommandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some\npeople are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.\nIt is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary\nargument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such\nbehavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers.\n\nI won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.\nFundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your\nassumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of\nlaws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of\nwhich Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine\nthem.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are \"moral\" and\nwhich ones are \"ritual.\"  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology\ncourse should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories\nin an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).\nAnd I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus\nfrom the \"ritual law\" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.\n\nI'm dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this\nmatter) about how \"repulsive\" and \"unnatural\" our acts are -- and what\ndo they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of\narbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating\ninsects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you\nsay that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part\nof the ritual law?\n\nFor those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\nbe \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\nit is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\ndetermine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the\nwhole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: \"No doubt I am free to do anything.\"\nBut Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,\nthe Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go\nthrough Leviticus and decide each \"command\" there on that basis, then\nyour own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this\ncontext, it is remarkably offensive to say:\n\n>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the\n>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.\n\nWell, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the\none that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously\n(though one can always find jokers) in \"defense\" of bestiality.  It is\nabsolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\nraise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\nadult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\nthan the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you\nare being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the\nworld.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not\nmine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in\nour culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing\nus as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means\nyou can think of to do so.\n\nJesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,\nthe central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to\nlove one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-\nians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get\nin return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.\n\nChristians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every\ncorner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same\nold verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never\neven read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with\nthe vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\nmanage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great\nemotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even\ntaking the trouble to find out what it is.\n\nSuch behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.\nWHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to\ncondemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN\nto BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?\nGod forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or\ncondemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in\ninsisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are\nSO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.\n\nWhy, for God's sake?\n\n\t\"For God did not send the Son into the world\n\tto condemn the world,\n\tbut that the world might be saved through him.\n\tWhoever believes in him is not condemned,\n\tbut whoever does not believe has already been condemned\n\tfor refusing to believe in the name of God's only Son.\n\tNow the judgment is this:\n\tthe light has come into the world,\n\tbut men have preferred darkness to light\n\tbecause their deeds were evil.\n\tFor everyone who practices wickedness\n\thates the light,\n\tand does not come near the light\n\tfor fear his deeds will be exposed.\n\tBut he who acts in truth\n\tcomes into the light,\n\tso that it may be sh0own\n\tthat his deeds are done in God.\"\tJohn 3:17-21\n\nFor long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from\nevil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and\nrejected.

STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC\n\n\tYour natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to\npanic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get right\nwith God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your \nonly chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the \nTribulation.  \"But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be \nsaved.\" - Matthew 24:13\n\nII. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION\n\n\tThe Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of\nthe rapture until Christ's second coming.  Also know as \"the time of Jacob's\n(Israel's) trouble\" (Jere 30:7) and \"Daniel's Seventieth Week\" (Dan 9), this \nperiod will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.\n\nIII. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM\n\n\tSoon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community \n(the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will\nbe tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable \npossession during the Tribulation.\n\nIV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tSince all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it\nis imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can\nquote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, \nRevelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to\nunfold before you.  \n\nV. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tPray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray \nand pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual \nstrength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the\nsake of Christ.  \n\nVI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED\nONES DIE AS MARTYRS\n\n\tAfter the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he\nwill institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell,\nor eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be\nuseless.  \"And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and \nslave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that\nno one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, \nor the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding\ncalculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number\nis 666\" - Revelation 13:16-18.  \n\tThe Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of \nhumanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed\nin the past, such as the Holocaust.\n[or maybe the crusades? -M]\nYou cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's\nrule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) \"...I saw\nunder the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and\nfor the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of \nthem: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, \nuntil both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be\nkilled as they were, was completed.\" Revelation 6:9, 11.\n\tHis targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image\nor take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ \"...And I saw the souls of \nthose who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of \nGod, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark\non their foreheads or on the hands.\" - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every\nform of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor\nwill he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, \ntorturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take\nthe mark.  \n\tIf you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,\nyou will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.\n[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]\nYou cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and\ngain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake\nof Fire.  \"...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his \nmark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of\nthe wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His \nindignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the \npresence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.\" -Revelation \n14:9-10 \n\n[and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to\nthe first 5,000 at the stadium --M] \n\nVII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL\n\n\tAlthough you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist's government\nuntil the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is \nimportant for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are\nextremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.\n\tThe first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or\nmountainous area, for the Antichrist's control will come last to the least\npopulated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay \nattuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.\n[\"As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep\ninto our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school\nclosings\" --M] \nStore water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without\nthe mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste\nfrom nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.\n[Get a good water filter. --M]\nBring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,\nbatteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to \nsurvive and live off the land as the pioneers did.\n\nVIII. TRUST NO ONE\n\t\n\tThere will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist's\ngovernment.  Be on the lookout.\n[Perot supporters take note --M]\n\nIX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST\n\n\tIt is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,\nfor he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will\nbring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel \n11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a\nhalf years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be \nphysically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and \npersonality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic\nexpert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which\nhe will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural \npower that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will\nbe deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.\n[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]\n\tThe antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who\nwill make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  \nAll who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and\na half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.\n\nX. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!\n\n\tThe seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of\nChrist.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you \nwill be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  \n\tStart reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of \nyour sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take\nthe mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or\nremain saved, but this time you will have to be \"faithful unto death.\"\n\n\tMay God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!\n\n******************************************************************************\nMike Cluff\t\t\t\t*  \"Christianity is Stupid.\nv22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms\t*   Give up.\" -Negativland\nUB Language Perception Laboratory\t*  \n******************************************************************************\n\n\n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\ \n\nBob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM \n\nThey said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,\nand sank Manhattan out at sea.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n", "true_class": 0, "title": "ID 94 (FP)"}, {"text": "From: hudson@athena.cs.uga.edu (Paul Hudson Jr)\nSubject: Re: homosexual issues in Christianity\nOrganization: University of Georgia, Athens\nLines: 38\n\nIn article <May.13.02.31.26.1993.1577@geneva.rutgers.edu> mls@panix.com (Michael Siemon) writes:\n>>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the\n>>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.\n\n> It is\n>absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\n>raise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\n>adult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\n>than the laws of kashrut.

This is very important.\nAnyone who would want to say that this command against homosexuality\ndeals with temple prostitution (and I think you would agree that there\nis no proof for this.)

The issue at hand is \nthe sinfulness having sex with members of the same sex, or lusting after.\nSo other forbidden sex acts are a valid topic for conversation. \n\nAnd the idea that these relationships may be  emotional  relationships\nbetween adult humans is red herring.

A week ago, I managed to find time to consult\na Septuagint Concordance and a LXX text with apparatus at the library,\nand I can now usefully conclude my look at the Greek words for love as\nused in the Christian background of the Septuagintal translation of the\nJewish scriptures.\n\nThe principal result is that there is a cluster of uses of the verbal\nnoun from _erao:_, _eraste:s_ meaning \"lover.\"  This cluster occurs just\nwhere one might most expect it, in the propethic image (and accusation)\nof Israel as faithless spouse to YHWH.  The verses in question are Hosea\n2:5,7 & 10; Jeremiah 4:30, 22:20 & 22; Lamentations 1:19; and Ezekiel\n16:33, 36 &37 and 23:5, 9 & 22.\n\n\t[ Hosea seems to have originated this usage, which Jeremiah and\n\t  Ezekiel picked up;  Lamentations is dependent on, though not\n\t  likely written by, Jeremiah. ]\n\nThe \"erotic\" meaning (in its allegorical use, not at all literally) is\nevident.  So too in English, unless you complement it with a phrase like\n\"of the arts\" the word \"lover\" is going to have an overtone of sexual\nrelationship.  There is no surprise here, but it is worthwhile to see\nthat standard Greek usage *does* show up in the translations from the\nHebrew! :-)\n\nMore interestingly, and some confirmation of my guess that later Koine\nusage avoided the verb _erao:_ because of its homonymy to _ero:_ (say),\n_eromai_ (ask), there is an error in Codex Vaticanus (normally, a very\nvaluable witness) where a form of _erao:_ is used in a completely absurd\ncontext -- 2 Samuel 20:18, where the  meaning *must* be \"say.\"\n\nIn addition to the above (and the uses I have already mentioned in Proverbs),\nEsther 2:17 uses the verb in its most natural application, \n\n\tkai e:rasthe\" ho basileus Esthe:r  --  and the King loved Esther\n\nand, rather more interestingly, 1 Samuel 19:2 supplies a modest degree of\nsupport to the gay appraisal of the relationship of David and Jonathan:\n\n\tkai Io:nathan huios Saoul e:[i]reito ton Dauid sphodra\n\t-- and Jonathan, Saul's son, loved David intensely\n\n\t[ I'm using the bracketed [i] for io:ta subscript, which I\n\t  don't yet have a reasonable ASCII convention for. ]\n\n(The relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about\nthe \"historical\" facts, but just that a quasi-official translation of\nthe Hebrew text in the Hellenistic period makes no bones about using the\n\"erotic\" verb in this context.  Given the quite general usage of _agapao:_\nfor erotic senses, this need not mean anything \"more\" than _agapao:_ alone\nwould mean, but it DOES disambiguate the relationship, as far as this\ntranslator goes!)\n-- \nMichael L.

That's quite\ndifferent from Hell Classic (TM). :-) Jesus doesn't sound like the\nusual hell-fire type of preacher.  He attracts people through what he\ndoes. And the stongest example in Jesus preaching is in the parable of \nLazarus and Dives, which is a parable!  In any case, my point is that\na fear-based response to Christ is not a freeing, life-affirming choice\nand isn't Good News in a meaningful sense.  There are plenty of good \nreasons to follow Jesus that have nothing to do with fear or a literal \nhell, that still pertain to overcoming in the present struggle between \nGod and the Disloyal Opposition.  A faith based in fear is not built\non Rock, as we should found our faith, but on ice.  If the fear were\nremoved, there would BE no foundation.  \n\nThat's basically why it matters to me.

Wingate       \n\nMaybe you should dig a little further Charles.  Hislop's scholarship was\naccepted by the Bristish Oriental Institute which, at the time, was the premere\nInstitute for Oriental studies.  As I've stated over and over,  I've checked\nout about 25% of his references (most are now out of print or in private\nlibraries) and the likes of Wilkerson and Layard hold their own merit.  THey\ntoo came to the same conclusions and if you will trouble yourself, you will\nfind that their knowledge of the mysteries have yet to be surpassed.  Both were\nhighly honored by the British Oriental Museum.  Wilkerson is known as one of\nthe leading archeologist in the history of Egyptiology and Layard is still\nbeing refered two after 200 yrs of archeology in the Mesopotamian regions.  He\nwas recently refered to in a TIME article on Babylonian archeology.  \n\nPhony scholarship is when you review their references and find that they have\nmisquoted or misrepresented the conclusions.  Hislop did not.  His conclusions\ndo not tickle the ears, that much is self evident.  But to assert that his\nconclusions are \"spurious\" is without merit.  He gave references to all his\nconclusions and as I have stated, for the last 25 years I have used his\nconclusions in debates at RC seminaries and brotherhoods, not to mention the\nindividual priests and bishops that I have talked to one on one.  No counter to\nHislops scholarship was made.  The only rebuttals were against his conclusions\nbecause they do totally undermined the claims of the RCC. He was showing that\nthe intitution of the RCC was based on the mysteries (which others have shown\neven to this day in various articles and topics).  THe tongues movement in\nCorinth was a direct result of the mysteries entering into the church.  If it\nwas so in Corinth, why could they not have an influence in Rome, the city of\nseven hills?\n\nAlso, you do not have to listen to his conclusions, you can draw your own\nconclusions by looking at the customs, artifacts, the cerimonial dress, the\ndocrine of purgatory, etc from the vantage of the mysteries.  You don't even\nhave to be a believer to see the parallels.  Just one example.  THe mitre. \nWhere did it come from?  Why is it shaped the way it is?  What are the two\ntails that hang down the back represent?  Was this an ancient  head dress from\nan earlier culture and why was it in Rome at the time of the beginnings of the\nchurch of the State of Rome?  Does it have pagan history behind it, and if so,\nwhy did the RCC chose regardless?\n\nAny lay person of middle eastern religion can answer these questions.  Even the\nscriptures themselves refer to it.  All Hislop did was collect the information\nfrom all the various sources and put them in one binding.  There is no lack of\nscholorship in that.\n\nPlease tell me why you discredit this man by your accusation, yet present no\nevidence supporting it.  \n\n--Rex\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 249 (FN)"}, {"text": "From: christen@astro.ocis.temple.edu (Carl Christensen)\nSubject: Re: Books\nOrganization: Temple University\nLines: 4\nNntp-Posting-Host: astro.ocis.temple.edu\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]\n\n[stuff about hard to find atheist books deleted]\n\nPerhaps the infiltration of fundies onto school boards, city councils,\netc. has something to do with why you can't find alternative media?\n", "true_class": 0, "title": "ID 20 (TN)"}, {"text": "From: cmtan@iss.nus.sg (Tan Chade Meng - dan)\nSubject: Christianity & Logic (was: Xtian Morality is)\nOrganization: Institute Of Systems Science, NUS\nX-Newsreader: Tin 1.1 PL4\nLines: 59\n\n\nIn article <4949@eastman.UUCP> dps@nasa.kodak.com writes:\n>Simple logic arguments are folly.

The teacher of the class is what I consider to be\nclosed-minded and bigotted on the subject of what the definition of\nChristianity is.  His definition is tied directly to that of the\nTrinity and the Catholic church's definition of it and belief in\nJesus Christ is not sufficient to call one's self a Christian.\n\nWhile his saying it doesn't make it so,  I nevertheless feel insulted\n(or am I just neurotic? :^) ). I would like to be able to respond to\nhim with some sense of literacy while maintaining an amiable\nstudent-teacher relationship.\n\nSo, is there common definition of what Christianity is?  As the\nprevious discussion of the Trinity did not lend itself to an exchange\nof flames, I am hopeful that this will also not produce major\nflames.\n\nRegards,\n--\nLarry Autry\nSilicon Graphics, St. Louis\nautry@sgi.com \n\n\n\n[Often we get into discussions about who is Christian.  Unfortunately\nthere are a number of possible definitions.  Starting from the \nbroadest, commonly used definitions are:\n\n  a historical definition\n  people who accept Christ as Lord and savior\n  a broad doctrinal definition\n  narrow doctrinal definitions\n\n1) By a historical definition I mean the sort of definition a secular\nhistorian would likely use.  This would include any group that\ndeveloped out of the Christian church, and continues within the same\nbroad culture.  E.g. some Unitarians would fail just about any\ndoctrinal test you could come up with.  Yet it's clear that that group\ndeveloped from Christianity, and people from very different\nbackgrounds (e.g. Hindus) would likely see them as part of\nChristianity.  This is not a definition most Christians like, but it's\nrelevant in some political and ethnic contexts.\n\n2) Accepting Christ as Lord and savior is a test used by many\nChristian groups for membership, e.g. the Southern Baptists and\nPresbyterian Church (USA).  I would qualify it by saying that what\nmost people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to Christ, so that\nsomeone who accepted Christ as one of many gods would not fit.  It's\nan attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not based\non technical doctrine.  By this definition, groups such as Arians\nwould be viewed as heretical Christians, but still Christians.  In the\nmodern context this would include Mormons, JW's, and \"oneness\nPentecostals\".  They would be viewed as heretical Christians, but\nstill Christian.  In practice I believe just about everyone who falls\ninto this category would accept the Apostle's Creed.\n\n3) The next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition,\nwhich includes all of the major strands of Christianity, but excludes\ngroups that are felt to be outside \"historic Christianity.\"  This is\nof course a slippery enterprise, since Catholics could argue that\nProtestants are outside historic Christianity, etc.  But I think the\nmost commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the\nNicene Creed and the Formula of Chalcedon.  The attempt is to\ncharacterize doctrines that all major strands of Christianity agree\nare key.  Obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement.  A\nMormon will regard the LDS church as a major strand, and thus will not\nwant to include anything that contradicts their beliefs.  But I think\nthis definition would have fairly broad acceptance.\n\n4) Finally, some people use definitions that I would say are limited\nto a specific Christian tradition.  E.g. some evangelicals only\nconsider someone Christian if he has had an evangelical-style\nconversion experience, and some I've even heard of groups that limit\nit to their specific church.\n\nI think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used.\nA lot is going to depend upon the purpose you're using it for.  If\nyou're using it descriptively, e.g. in history or anthropology, you'll\nprobably use definition 1 or 2.  If you're using it normatively, i.e.\nto say what you believe the Christian message is, you'll probably use\na definition like 3 or even 4.\n\n--clh]\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 8 (TP)"}, {"text": "From: mserv@mozart.cc.iup.edu (Mail Server)\nSubject: Re: Dreams and out of body incidents\nLines: 19\n\ndt4%cs@hub.ucsb.edu (David E.

The founder of this\nmovement, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), was proclaimed to \nbe the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in the Scriptures\nof almost all major religions of the world. He claimed to be the \nfulfillment of the long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ\n(metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah.\n\n        The claims of Hazrat Ahmad raised storms of hostility and\nextreme opposition, which are often witnessed in the history of \ndivine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted especial-\nly in some of the Muslim regimes. The right of Ahmadi Muslims to \nopenly practice their religion and to define themselves as Muslims\nhas been severely restricted in many Muslim Countries. The United\nNations, human rights organizations such as Amnesty International\nand top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns \nagainst this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the\nmembers of this movement, but so far to no avail.\n\n        Despite the opposition and persecution, the movement cont-\ninues to grow with a current membership of millions from around the\nworld in over 130 countries, who come from diverse ethnic and cul-\ntural backgrounds.\n\n        The movement is devoted to world peace and strives towards\ndeveloping a better understanding of all religions. Ahmadi Muslims\nhave always been opposed to all forms of violence, bigotry, reli-\ngious intolerance and fundamentalism.\n\n        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-\ntablished a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clinics\nin many third world countries. These institutions are staffed by\nvolunteer professionals and are fully financed by the movement's\ninternal resources. The movement stresses the importance of educa-\ntion and leadership. Its members have included a high number of\nprofessionals as well as world class individuals.\n\n        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral\nreform, establish peace and justice, and to unite mankind under\none universal brotherhood.\n\n\nNEWSGROUP CREATION: \n==================\n\n        The  discussion for this proposed newsgroup has now offi-\ncially ended. Voting will be held for three weeks. If the news-\ngroup gets 2/3rd majority AND 100 more \"YES/Create\" votes than\n\"NO/don't create\" votes; the newsgroup shall be created. \n\n\nABOUT THE VOTE-TAKER: \n====================\n\n        Mr. Anthony Lest has been asked by the proponents of\nthis newsgroup to act as an official impartial vote-taker for the\nproposed newsgroup.

Dr. James DeYoung; #3]\n\nR. Scroggs\n\n     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and\nsuggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a\n\"Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic\nterminology.\"  The term is derived from Lev 18\"22 & 20:13 where the LXX\njuxtaposes the two words arsenos (\"male\") and koiten (\"bed\"), and represents\nthe Hebrew miskab zabar (\"lying with a male\").   Yet he believes that Paul did\nnot originate the term, but borrowed it from \"circles of Hellenistic Jews\nacquainted with rabbinic discussions\" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid\n\"contact with the usual Greek terminology\" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs\nobserves, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions\nof pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to\nnative-speaking Greeks (108).\n\n     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the\nobject of the second part, thus differing from Boswell's \"learned discussion\"\n(107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of \"one who lies with a\nmale\" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9),\nwhich Scroggs interprets as \"the effeminate call-boy,\" arsenokoitai is the\nactive partner \"who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress' or who hires him on\noccasion to satisfy his sexual desires\" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not\nrefer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic\nmodel of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he\naffirms (109).\n     This is Scrogg's interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The\ncombination of pornoi (\"fornicators\"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai (\"slave\ndealers\") refers to \"male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave\ndealers [who procure them]\" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of\npederasty \"which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual\npurposes, and the use of these boys by adult males\" (121).  Even \"serious\nminded pagan authors\" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these\ninstances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently\ngeneral condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. \nConsequently Paul \"Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind\" (122).\nWe cannot know what Paul would have said about the \"contemporary model of\nadult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships\" (122).\n\n     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical\nconcerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of\nvices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and\nfunction of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any\nrelationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually\nnonexistent.  He concludes that Paul \"does not care about any specific item in\nthe lists\" (104). \n\n     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary\nphenomenon of a \"catalogue of vices,\"  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are\n\"irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today\" (129).  The \"model\nin today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model\nattacked by the NT\" that \"Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not\nrelevant to today's debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational\ndiscussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify\nrefusal of ordination. . . \" (127).\n\n      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI\n\nD. Wright\n\n     In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have\ncome under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell's\nview is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out\nseveral shortcomings of Boswell's treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults\nBoswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev\n18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the \"Apostolic\nConstitutions,\"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). \nBoswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term\nderives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This\nis significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell's\nclaim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the\ngender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean \"a male who sleeps with\na male,\" making arseno- the object.\n\n     Wright also faults Boswell's claims regarding linguistic features of the\nterm, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that\ncompounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it\nas an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely\none of dialectical diversity: \"No semantic import attaches to the difference\nbetween the two forms\" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which\nthe second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its\nobject and where \"the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its\ngender\" (132). \n\n     It is with Boswell's treatment of the early church fathers that Wright\ntakes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. \nFor example, Aristides' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis,\nandrobaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male\nhomosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell's discussion.  Boswell fails to cite\nHippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the\nSyriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to\nthe Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34). \n\n     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in\nparallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the\ndominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this\nparallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia (\"adultery\"), porneia\n(\"fornication\"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris\n(136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the\nTen Commandments as \"You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis (\"you shall not commit\nadultery\"), ou paidophthoreseis (\"you shall not practice homosexuality with\nboys\"), you shall not steal. . .\" (150 n. 43).\n\n     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein (\"commit homosexuality\") exists in the\nSibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was\ncoined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by\nOr.Sib., book 2 (137-38).\n\n     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew\nupon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John\nthe Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of\nhomosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.\n\n     Wright next replies to Boswell's contention that the term would not be\nabsent \"from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted\n(140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to\nthe first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used\ndozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g.\nDidache) show no acquaintance with Paul's letters or deliberately avoid citing\nScripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). \n\n     Boswell's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright's attention\n(141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom,\nomitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a\nlong uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom\n1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom's infrequent use of the term.  Wright\nobserves that Boswell has \"signally failed to demonstrate any us of\narsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual\nactivity\" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature\nand the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly\nspecified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world. \n\n     Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim\nand I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning\n\"homosexual\" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of\nthe word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell's limited\nconclusion based on them.\n\n     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the\ncatalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed\nin late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of\nhomosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the\npart of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into\nbeing under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke \"generally of\nmale activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual\nengagement with paides\" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were\ninterchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).\n\n     In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning\nhomosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and\nothers who limit the term to \"active male prostitutes\" or pederasty are without\nsignificant support from linguistic and historical studies.  \n\n[Next: the questioning of Wrights position by William Peterson.  After that, we\nget into the \"good\" stuff of historical & linguistic studies.  THis will\ninclude \"Symposium\" by Plato.  If there is any doubt as to the modern\nunderstanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time of\nPaul, this will certainly clear things up.  Also we will review Paul's use of\nLev18-20 in the NT and how, as for him, 1) the Law was fulfilled, but not done\naway with, 2) Lev 18-20 was the universal and the following chapters the\ngeneral.  Those who put forth that the OT no longer holds true today in our\nculture, should stick around for this one.]\n___________________________\n13 R. Scroggs, THe New Testament and Homosexuality (Phil: 1983) 86, 107-8. \nIndependently we came to the same conclusion.  Apparently the connection is\nmade in E.A. Sophocles, Greek Lexicon of the Roman & Byzantine Periods (from\n146BC to AD 1100).\n14   See discussion, 101-4.  He says the same thing about Paul's language in\nRom 1:26-27 (128).  But this is doubtful.  See the more cautious words of P.\nZaas, \"I Cor 6.9ff: Was Homosexuality Condoned in the Corinthian Church? SBLASP\n17 (1979):205-12.  He observes that the words moixai, malakoi, and arsenokoitai\nwere part of Jewish anti-Gentile polemic.  Yet Paul's wors at the end of the\nvice list, \"and such were some of you,\" indicate that \"Paul is addressing real\nor potential abuses of his ethical message, not citing primitive tradition by\nrote\" (210).  Wright disputes Zaas' attempt to associate the term with idolatry\n(147).\n15  On Boswell's treatment of Rom 1:26-7, the article by R.B. Hays, \"Relations\nNatural and Unnatural\"  A Response to John Boswell's Exegesis of Romans 1,\" JRE\n14/1 (Spring 1986): 184-215, is an excellent critique.\n16  D.F. Wright, \"Homosexuals or Prostitutes?  The Meaning of ARSENOKOITAI (I\nCor 6:9, I Tim 1:10), VC 38 (1984):125-53.\n17  In an unpublished paper, Henry Mendell, \"ARSENOKOITAI: Boswell on Paul,\"\neffectively refutres Boswell's claims regarding the philology of arsenokoitai. \nHe finds the meaning to be general, \"a male who has sex with a male\" (4-11).  \n18  Wright's endnotes (148-49) list additional sources in the church fathers.\n19   We also have noticed the same tendency by Boswell to fail to cite all the\nreferences to Sodom and sodomy in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha.  See  J.B.\nDeYoung, \"A Critique of Prohomosexual Interpretations of the OT Apocrypha and\nPseudepigrapha,\" BSac 146/588 (1990):437-53.\n20   In light of the claim made by Boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitai\npoints to a meaning lacking homosexual significance, Wright asks pertinently\n\"why neither Philo nor Josephus use  paidofthoria, nor Josephus paiderastia,\nand why . . Clement did not use the latter and Chrysostom the former?\"  (152 n.\n71)  In a more recent article, \"Homosexuality: The Relevance of the Bible,\" EvQ\n61 (1989):291-300, Wright reiterates these same points.  Paul shows a\n\"remarkable originality\" in extending the OT ethic to the church (300).\n\n \n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 12 (TP)"}, {"text": "From: sandvik@newton.apple.com (Kent Sandvik)\nSubject: Re: SOC.RELIGION.CHRISTIAN\nOrganization: Cookamunga Tourist Bureau\nLines: 23\n\nIn article <May.16.01.56.14.1993.6674@geneva.rutgers.edu>,\nsfp@lemur.cit.cornell.edu (Sheila Patterson) wrote:\n> As for the atheists/agnostics who read this list: if you aren't\n> christian and if you have no intention of ever becoming one why on\n> earth do you waste your time and mine by participating on a christian\n> discussion list ?\n\nI don't think we should draw borders around newsgroups, christians\nare free to read and post entries on the atheist newsgroups, and \nmuslims are free to so so in other groups as well.\n\nIt's up to each individual to define their time schedule concerning \npostings.

If you are surveying our individual\nphilosophies, fine, but that's not strictly atheism. Atheism is not\njust another, godless version of the theistic explanations for life,\nthe universe and everything.

You also seem to have rather strange ideas of how people become\natheists - those who are alienated from religion do not necessarily\nbecome atheists, they just think very little about religion.

A generation\nbefore the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh,\ngateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather\nthan God's way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which would\nhave given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored their\ndecision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the\nland of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision-\nmakers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and\ndestined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the\ntime they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderers\nhad been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with a\nsigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they\nwere going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence.\nWhatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached\nbones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression of\nhopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nation\nat Kadesh and had God' s promise of one day entering the land. The\nforty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, those\nwho were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the\ninheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Moses\nprays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over.\nAll these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining\npeople through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden.\nHis was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but\nhe also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem was\nthat they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. \"Who is your\nGod?\" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. When\nAaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or young\nbull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bull\nwho had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt's gods as He led\nIsrael to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles grow\nthin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and water\ngushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the\nGod of Almightiness becomes \"ho-hum --What' s next on the miracle menu?\"\nAnd a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He might\nbe all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a right\nto do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these people\nhad known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men's lives had hung\non the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believed\nGod could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIM\nand, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, His\nacts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From the\nday of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God.\nAt Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. He\nhad seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. This\nrequest was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God's glorious\nPerson. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and\nlovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word \"lovingkindness\" is not to be\nunderstood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationship\narising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as the\nlove that says, \"I will never leave you nor forsake you.\" Lovingkindness is as\ntenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its\nheels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based on\nfeelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and,\ntherefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God's love is not an emotion\nthat wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our\nhighest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. God\ndoes not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings\nof love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with\nus! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Him\nto reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- not\nbecause of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committed\nto us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He will\nnot let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us--\nbut a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It is\nsaying to the recipient, \"For as long as we shall live, I am for you.\"  The God\nwho has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--in\nHis coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who is\nlovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will never\nleave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him as\nlove; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeing\nmiracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in the\nheart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power.\nMoses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had for\nthese people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, they\ncould not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born out\nof knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One who\ngives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is to\nmiss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  If\nman is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on\nknowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues from\nlove demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years of\nmeaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to\nknow the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and the\npossibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. The\nlanguage Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its\nmother's love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It is\nwaking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for,\nprotected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we were\nto ask, \"What has the baby done to deserve this?\" or, \"Have arrangements\nbeen made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?\" Our\nquestions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child was\nconceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love's excitement, a love\nthat has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents' love is\nunconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child\nor its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally,\nspontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after\nHis image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the\nLord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to\nearn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identity\nthrough the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents' love. It is a\nscientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if\nit survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has been\nheld and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the\nembrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the new\ngeneration will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in\nthe love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and\ngladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His\nlove. \"Satisfied.\" in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing\nbeing filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describe\nthe earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received\nenough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be\ndrenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is the\nlifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in our\ndeepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems\ndisappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling\nthat he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make\nsense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks this\nsatisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the\nemotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in\nreligious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding\nto the love of the living God. Only in knowing God's love will the rest of life\nmake sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again\nbecame the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find it\nfascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His\nlove. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one would\nthink he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by\nthe knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knew\nbetter. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won't\nfind it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to\nmanipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and\ngive us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyes\nand satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking God\nto make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses' prayer was partially\nanswered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which\nworked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in its\nfullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out the\nlove of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church,\nwe read of the Holy Spirit \"falling upon\" the believers. This is an ancient\nexpression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used in\nLuke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and \"falling on his\nneck and kissing him.\" The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest\nself and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your\nbeing. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes.\nMoses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization\nthat we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taught\nus to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in a\nstate of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance\nand love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive love\nwe cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the Holy\nSpirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness to\nthink on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jaded\nwith the doctrine of \"perform to be accepted.\" We begin to realize that He\nloves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challenge\neveryone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your\neyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may not\nfeel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed the\nother day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians kept\nbehind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rays\nwithout being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing\nthat we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according to\nMoses, \"joy and gladness all our days.\" Joy is the result of a life that is\nfunctioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might say\nthat joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. Man' s highest\nperformance is to rest in the love God has for him... the hum will be joy, and\nthe result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now\nhas in life. Stop wandering in the wilderness. Be satisfied with His love and,\nin joy, day by day, receive all His promised blessings.\n\n\n----- End Included Message -----\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 18 (TP)"}, {"text": "From: frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O'Dwyer)\nSubject: Re: Societal basis for morality\nOrganization: Siemens-Nixdorf AG\nLines: 49\nNNTP-Posting-Host: d012s658.ap.mchp.sni.de\n\nIn article <1993Apr20.004119.6119@cnsvax.uwec.edu> nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu (David Nye) writes:\n\nYou asked me to look over here, but I was on my way back anyway :-)\n\n#[reply to cobb@alexia.lis.uiuc.edu (Mike Cobb)]\n# \n#>If morals come from what is societally accepted, why follow that?

Karma is considered to\nbe a moral process in which intentions (either good or evil) shape\na person's predilections for future intention and action and\nproduce a person who is more prone to good than evil, or the opposite --\n\"reward\" has nothing to do with it.

I would think that would be great _fun_, not having ever\nfelt the joy and peace the Christians speak of with a longing gaze.\nThis is not what I got when I believed - I just tried to hide my fear\nof getting punished for something I never was sure of.

So .. ?\n\nI suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe\nand analyse their position. In fact, it is amusing to note in this\ncontext that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the\nopposite - one should not examine one's belief critically.\n\nI'll tell you something I left out of my 'testimony' I posted to this\ngroup two months ago. A day after I finally found out my faith is over,\nI decided to try just one more time. The same cycle of emotional\nresponses fired once again, but this time the delusion lasted only\na couple of hours. I told my friend in a phone that it really works,\nthank god, just to think about it again when I hung up.

I learned what it means to use _reason_.\n\nAs a student of chemistry, I had to perform a qualitative analysis\nof a mixture of two organic compounds in the lab. I _hated_ experiments\nlike this - they are old-fashioned and increase the student's workload\nconsiderably. Besides, I had to do it twice, since I failed in my first\nattempt. However, I think I'll never forget the lesson: \n\nNo matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is X,\nit may still be Y. It is _very_ tempting to jump into conclusions, take\na leap of faith, assure oneself, ignore the data which is inconsistent. \nBut it can still be wrong. \n\nI found out that I was, after all, using exactly the same mechanism\nto believe in god - mental self-assurance, suspension of fear, \nfiltering of information. In other words, it was only me, no god\nplaying any part. \n\n> The life , death, and resurection of Christ is documented historical fact.\n\nOh? And I had better believe this? Dan, many UFO stories are much better\ndocumented than the resurrection of Jesus. The resurrection is documented\nquite haphazardly in the Bible - it seems the authors did not pay too\nmuch attention to which wild rumour to leave out. Besides, the ends of\nthe gospels probably contain later additions and insertions; for instance,\nthe end of Mark (16:9-20) is missing from many early texts, says my Bible.\n\nJesus may have lived and died, but he was probably misunderstood.\n\n> As much\n> as anything else you learn.  How do you choose what to believe and \n> what not to?\n\nThis is easy. I believe that the world exists independent of my mind,\nand that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what I\nobserve. Nothing else need to be taken on faith, I will go by the\nevidence. \n\nIt makes no difference whether I believe George Washington existed or not.\nI assume that he did, considering the vast amount of evidence presented.\n\n> There is no way to get into a sceptical heart.

Those who do are usually remembered\nas heroes, at least among those who believe. Dan, do you think I'm\nlying when I say I believed firmly for 15 years? It seems it is \nvery difficult to admit that someone who has really believed does not\ndo so anymore. But I can't go on lying to myself.\n\nBlind trust is dangerous, and I was just another blind led by the blind.\nBut if god really wants me, she'll know what to do. I'm willing.

Also know as \"the time of Jacob's\n(Israel's) trouble\" (Jere 30:7) and \"Daniel's Seventieth Week\" (Dan 9), this \nperiod will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.\n\nIII. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM\n\n\tSoon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community \n(the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will\nbe tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable \npossession during the Tribulation.\n\nIV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tSince all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it\nis imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can\nquote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, \nRevelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to\nunfold before you.  \n\nV. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tPray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray \nand pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual \nstrength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the\nsake of Christ.  \n\nVI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED\nONES DIE AS MARTYRS\n\n\tAfter the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he\nwill institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell,\nor eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be\nuseless.  \"And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and \nslave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that\nno one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, \nor the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding\ncalculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number\nis 666\" - Revelation 13:16-18.  \n\tThe Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of \nhumanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed\nin the past, such as the Holocaust.\n[or maybe the crusades? -M]\nYou cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's\nrule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) \"...I saw\nunder the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and\nfor the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of \nthem: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, \nuntil both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be\nkilled as they were, was completed.\" Revelation 6:9, 11.\n\tHis targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image\nor take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ \"...And I saw the souls of \nthose who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of \nGod, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark\non their foreheads or on the hands.\" - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every\nform of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor\nwill he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, \ntorturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take\nthe mark.  \n\tIf you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,\nyou will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.\n[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]\nYou cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and\ngain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake\nof Fire.  \"...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his \nmark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of\nthe wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His \nindignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the \npresence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.\" -Revelation \n14:9-10 \n\n[and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to\nthe first 5,000 at the stadium --M] \n\nVII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL\n\n\tAlthough you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist's government\nuntil the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is \nimportant for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are\nextremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.\n\tThe first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or\nmountainous area, for the Antichrist's control will come last to the least\npopulated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay \nattuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.\n[\"As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep\ninto our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school\nclosings\" --M] \nStore water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without\nthe mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste\nfrom nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.\n[Get a good water filter. --M]\nBring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,\nbatteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to \nsurvive and live off the land as the pioneers did.\n\nVIII. TRUST NO ONE\n\t\n\tThere will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist's\ngovernment.  Be on the lookout.\n[Perot supporters take note --M]\n\nIX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST\n\n\tIt is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,\nfor he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will\nbring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel \n11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a\nhalf years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be \nphysically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and \npersonality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic\nexpert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which\nhe will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural \npower that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will\nbe deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.\n[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]\n\tThe antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who\nwill make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  \nAll who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and\na half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.\n\nX. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!\n\n\tThe seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of\nChrist.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you \nwill be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  \n\tStart reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of \nyour sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take\nthe mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or\nremain saved, but this time you will have to be \"faithful unto death.\"\n\n\tMay God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!\n\n******************************************************************************\nMike Cluff\t\t\t\t*  \"Christianity is Stupid.\nv22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms\t*   Give up.\" -Negativland\nUB Language Perception Laboratory\t*  \n******************************************************************************\n\n\n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\ \n\nBob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM \n\nThey said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,\nand sank Manhattan out at sea.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n", "true_class": 0, "title": "ID 94 (TN-FP)"}, {"text": "From: madhaus@netcom.com (Maddi Hausmann)\nSubject: Re: Amusing atheists and agnostics\nOrganization: Society for Putting Things on Top of Other Things\nLines: 26\n\ntimmbake@mcl.ucsb.edu (\"Half\" Bake Timmons) writes: >\nMaddi: >>\n\n>>Whirr click whirr...Frank O'Dwyer might also be contained\n>>in that shell...pop stack to determine...whirr...click..whirr\n>\n>>\"Killfile\" Keith Allen Schneider = Frank \"Closet Theist\" O'Dwyer = ...\n\n>= Maddi \"The Mad Sound-O-Geek\" Hausmann\n\nNo, no, no!

I get a little queasy around the phrase \"aren't morally \nresponsible\", perhaps because I've heard it misused so many times.\n(I remember in college some folk trying to argue that a person who\nwas drunk was not morally responsible for his actions.) In general,\nmost folk can't control their dreams, but perhaps what you do all day\nand think about has some impact on them, hm? And I'm not sure what\n\"actions\" are in a dream. But I will note that Jesus does seem adamant\nabout the fact that our thought-life is at least as important as\nour actions. Go lightly with this argument - we are all morally\nresponsible for *who we are* and dreams might well be an important\npart of that.\n\n>Now, there seem to be 3 alternatives:\n>1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.

I've had dreams, some\nfairly vivid ones; is an OOBE just a very vivid dream? I would argue that\nextreme interest in this sort of phenomena is a tad risky; it is probably\nmuch better to think about who Jesus is, and who we are in relation to that,\nthan to cultivate a strong interest in dreams. Unless you feel plagued by\ndreams that are painful and out of control; then pray about it and/or get help.\n\n>2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane')\n>Evidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in\n>common by more than one person.\nWhat on Earth is your definition of \"often\"? I know exactly one case of\ntwo people who had substantially the same dream at the same time, and\nas they were brothers who had spent the day doing the same things I could\nsee why their dreams might be similiar. Anyway, the only \"other plane\" I\nknow of is the spiritual realm. I don't think *anyone's* dreams,\nperhaps outside the occasional prophet's, represent actual actions on an\nalternate plane. If they were real actions, or conscious thoughts, then\nyes they would have direct moral significance.\n\n>3) Like (2), but here we assume that [garbled text: \"because the dream occurs\nin a different environment, then different moral laws apply\" is my guess of\nwhat you said.]\nI don't see the slightest hint in Christian writings that ones \"environment\"\nchanges the way a person determines what is moral.

Is one of these cases the truth, or does anyone know\n>of another alternative?  respond by post or email.\nTruth? I don't claim to be an expert in dreams. I'll note that the Bible\ndoesn't talk much about dreams outside of the realm of God using them to speak\nto us, with the caveat that such messages are not always very clear, as it\nwarns somewhere in the OT. Given that, I would not give them a lot of\nattention unless you feel your dreams are trying to tell you something.\n\nI would discount talk of \"alternate planes,\" though. The only places such\nconcepts are commonly bandied about are for the most part hostile to\nChristianity, though I've run into the occasional exception.

If you are surveying our individual\nphilosophies, fine, but that's not strictly atheism.

A week ago, I managed to find time to consult\na Septuagint Concordance and a LXX text with apparatus at the library,\nand I can now usefully conclude my look at the Greek words for love as\nused in the Christian background of the Septuagintal translation of the\nJewish scriptures.\n\nThe principal result is that there is a cluster of uses of the verbal\nnoun from _erao:_, _eraste:s_ meaning \"lover.\"  This cluster occurs just\nwhere one might most expect it, in the propethic image (and accusation)\nof Israel as faithless spouse to YHWH.  The verses in question are Hosea\n2:5,7 & 10; Jeremiah 4:30, 22:20 & 22; Lamentations 1:19; and Ezekiel\n16:33, 36 &37 and 23:5, 9 & 22.\n\n\t[ Hosea seems to have originated this usage, which Jeremiah and\n\t  Ezekiel picked up;  Lamentations is dependent on, though not\n\t  likely written by, Jeremiah. ]\n\nThe \"erotic\" meaning (in its allegorical use, not at all literally) is\nevident.  So too in English, unless you complement it with a phrase like\n\"of the arts\" the word \"lover\" is going to have an overtone of sexual\nrelationship.  There is no surprise here, but it is worthwhile to see\nthat standard Greek usage *does* show up in the translations from the\nHebrew! :-)\n\nMore interestingly, and some confirmation of my guess that later Koine\nusage avoided the verb _erao:_ because of its homonymy to _ero:_ (say),\n_eromai_ (ask), there is an error in Codex Vaticanus (normally, a very\nvaluable witness) where a form of _erao:_ is used in a completely absurd\ncontext -- 2 Samuel 20:18, where the  meaning *must* be \"say.\"\n\nIn addition to the above (and the uses I have already mentioned in Proverbs),\nEsther 2:17 uses the verb in its most natural application, \n\n\tkai e:rasthe\" ho basileus Esthe:r  --  and the King loved Esther\n\nand, rather more interestingly, 1 Samuel 19:2 supplies a modest degree of\nsupport to the gay appraisal of the relationship of David and Jonathan:\n\n\tkai Io:nathan huios Saoul e:[i]reito ton Dauid sphodra\n\t-- and Jonathan, Saul's son, loved David intensely\n\n\t[ I'm using the bracketed [i] for io:ta subscript, which I\n\t  don't yet have a reasonable ASCII convention for. ]\n\n(The relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about\nthe \"historical\" facts, but just that a quasi-official translation of\nthe Hebrew text in the Hellenistic period makes no bones about using the\n\"erotic\" verb in this context.  Given the quite general usage of _agapao:_\nfor erotic senses, this need not mean anything \"more\" than _agapao:_ alone\nwould mean, but it DOES disambiguate the relationship, as far as this\ntranslator goes!)\n-- \nMichael L.

I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of\nactivity that could be named by \"fornication\" or \"theft\" or \"coveting\" or\n\"reviling\" or \"drunkenness\" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may\nor may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very\nfact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at\nall \"clear\" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest\nin MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,\nwith all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated\nChristian discussion of ALL these areas.\n\nHomosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I\nknow) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and\nchild molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly\n\"harmless\" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --\nthat would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter\nyou cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that\nyou want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]\n\n\t\"'I am free to do anything,' you say.  Yes, but not everything\n\tis for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one\n\twill not let anything make free with me.\"  [1 Cor. 6:12]\n\nWhich is a restatement that we must have no other \"god\" before God.  A\ncommandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some\npeople are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.\nIt is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary\nargument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such\nbehavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers.\n\nI won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.\nFundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your\nassumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of\nlaws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of\nwhich Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine\nthem.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are \"moral\" and\nwhich ones are \"ritual.\"  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology\ncourse should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories\nin an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).\nAnd I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus\nfrom the \"ritual law\" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.\n\nI'm dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this\nmatter) about how \"repulsive\" and \"unnatural\" our acts are -- and what\ndo they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of\narbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating\ninsects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you\nsay that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part\nof the ritual law?\n\nFor those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\nbe \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\nit is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\ndetermine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the\nwhole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: \"No doubt I am free to do anything.\"\nBut Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,\nthe Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go\nthrough Leviticus and decide each \"command\" there on that basis, then\nyour own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this\ncontext, it is remarkably offensive to say:\n\n>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the\n>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.\n\nWell, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the\none that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously\n(though one can always find jokers) in \"defense\" of bestiality.  It is\nabsolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\nraise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\nadult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\nthan the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you\nare being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the\nworld.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not\nmine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in\nour culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing\nus as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means\nyou can think of to do so.\n\nJesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,\nthe central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to\nlove one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-\nians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get\nin return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.\n\nChristians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every\ncorner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same\nold verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never\neven read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with\nthe vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\nmanage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great\nemotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even\ntaking the trouble to find out what it is.\n\nSuch behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.\nWHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to\ncondemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN\nto BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?\nGod forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or\ncondemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in\ninsisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are\nSO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.\n\nWhy, for God's sake?\n\n\t\"For God did not send the Son into the world\n\tto condemn the world,\n\tbut that the world might be saved through him.\n\tWhoever believes in him is not condemned,\n\tbut whoever does not believe has already been condemned\n\tfor refusing to believe in the name of God's only Son.\n\tNow the judgment is this:\n\tthe light has come into the world,\n\tbut men have preferred darkness to light\n\tbecause their deeds were evil.\n\tFor everyone who practices wickedness\n\thates the light,\n\tand does not come near the light\n\tfor fear his deeds will be exposed.\n\tBut he who acts in truth\n\tcomes into the light,\n\tso that it may be sh0own\n\tthat his deeds are done in God.\"\tJohn 3:17-21\n\nFor long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from\nevil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and\nrejected.

He gave references to all his\nconclusions and as I have stated, for the last 25 years I have used his\nconclusions in debates at RC seminaries and brotherhoods, not to mention the\nindividual priests and bishops that I have talked to one on one.  No counter to\nHislops scholarship was made.  The only rebuttals were against his conclusions\nbecause they do totally undermined the claims of the RCC. He was showing that\nthe intitution of the RCC was based on the mysteries (which others have shown\neven to this day in various articles and topics).  THe tongues movement in\nCorinth was a direct result of the mysteries entering into the church.  If it\nwas so in Corinth, why could they not have an influence in Rome, the city of\nseven hills?\n\nAlso, you do not have to listen to his conclusions, you can draw your own\nconclusions by looking at the customs, artifacts, the cerimonial dress, the\ndocrine of purgatory, etc from the vantage of the mysteries.

The founder of this\nmovement, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), was proclaimed to \nbe the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in the Scriptures\nof almost all major religions of the world. He claimed to be the \nfulfillment of the long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ\n(metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah.\n\n        The claims of Hazrat Ahmad raised storms of hostility and\nextreme opposition, which are often witnessed in the history of \ndivine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted especial-\nly in some of the Muslim regimes. The right of Ahmadi Muslims to \nopenly practice their religion and to define themselves as Muslims\nhas been severely restricted in many Muslim Countries. The United\nNations, human rights organizations such as Amnesty International\nand top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns \nagainst this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the\nmembers of this movement, but so far to no avail.\n\n        Despite the opposition and persecution, the movement cont-\ninues to grow with a current membership of millions from around the\nworld in over 130 countries, who come from diverse ethnic and cul-\ntural backgrounds.\n\n        The movement is devoted to world peace and strives towards\ndeveloping a better understanding of all religions. Ahmadi Muslims\nhave always been opposed to all forms of violence, bigotry, reli-\ngious intolerance and fundamentalism.\n\n        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-\ntablished a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clinics\nin many third world countries. These institutions are staffed by\nvolunteer professionals and are fully financed by the movement's\ninternal resources. The movement stresses the importance of educa-\ntion and leadership. Its members have included a high number of\nprofessionals as well as world class individuals.\n\n        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral\nreform, establish peace and justice, and to unite mankind under\none universal brotherhood.\n\n\nNEWSGROUP CREATION: \n==================\n\n        The  discussion for this proposed newsgroup has now offi-\ncially ended. Voting will be held for three weeks. If the news-\ngroup gets 2/3rd majority AND 100 more \"YES/Create\" votes than\n\"NO/don't create\" votes; the newsgroup shall be created. \n\n\nABOUT THE VOTE-TAKER: \n====================\n\n        Mr. Anthony Lest has been asked by the proponents of\nthis newsgroup to act as an official impartial vote-taker for the\nproposed newsgroup. He has no objection to  use his workstation\nfor the purpose of vote-taking. Neither the University of Colora-\ndo, nor Anthony Lest has anything to do with the proposal of the\nnewsgroup.

The teacher of the class is what I consider to be\nclosed-minded and bigotted on the subject of what the definition of\nChristianity is.  His definition is tied directly to that of the\nTrinity and the Catholic church's definition of it and belief in\nJesus Christ is not sufficient to call one's self a Christian.\n\nWhile his saying it doesn't make it so,  I nevertheless feel insulted\n(or am I just neurotic? :^) ). I would like to be able to respond to\nhim with some sense of literacy while maintaining an amiable\nstudent-teacher relationship.\n\nSo, is there common definition of what Christianity is?  As the\nprevious discussion of the Trinity did not lend itself to an exchange\nof flames, I am hopeful that this will also not produce major\nflames.\n\nRegards,\n--\nLarry Autry\nSilicon Graphics, St. Louis\nautry@sgi.com \n\n\n\n[Often we get into discussions about who is Christian.  Unfortunately\nthere are a number of possible definitions.  Starting from the \nbroadest, commonly used definitions are:\n\n  a historical definition\n  people who accept Christ as Lord and savior\n  a broad doctrinal definition\n  narrow doctrinal definitions\n\n1) By a historical definition I mean the sort of definition a secular\nhistorian would likely use.  This would include any group that\ndeveloped out of the Christian church, and continues within the same\nbroad culture.  E.g. some Unitarians would fail just about any\ndoctrinal test you could come up with.  Yet it's clear that that group\ndeveloped from Christianity, and people from very different\nbackgrounds (e.g. Hindus) would likely see them as part of\nChristianity.  This is not a definition most Christians like, but it's\nrelevant in some political and ethnic contexts.\n\n2) Accepting Christ as Lord and savior is a test used by many\nChristian groups for membership, e.g. the Southern Baptists and\nPresbyterian Church (USA).  I would qualify it by saying that what\nmost people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to Christ, so that\nsomeone who accepted Christ as one of many gods would not fit.  It's\nan attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not based\non technical doctrine.  By this definition, groups such as Arians\nwould be viewed as heretical Christians, but still Christians.  In the\nmodern context this would include Mormons, JW's, and \"oneness\nPentecostals\".  They would be viewed as heretical Christians, but\nstill Christian.  In practice I believe just about everyone who falls\ninto this category would accept the Apostle's Creed.\n\n3) The next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition,\nwhich includes all of the major strands of Christianity, but excludes\ngroups that are felt to be outside \"historic Christianity.\"  This is\nof course a slippery enterprise, since Catholics could argue that\nProtestants are outside historic Christianity, etc.  But I think the\nmost commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the\nNicene Creed and the Formula of Chalcedon.  The attempt is to\ncharacterize doctrines that all major strands of Christianity agree\nare key.  Obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement.  A\nMormon will regard the LDS church as a major strand, and thus will not\nwant to include anything that contradicts their beliefs.  But I think\nthis definition would have fairly broad acceptance.\n\n4) Finally, some people use definitions that I would say are limited\nto a specific Christian tradition.  E.g. some evangelicals only\nconsider someone Christian if he has had an evangelical-style\nconversion experience, and some I've even heard of groups that limit\nit to their specific church.\n\nI think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used.\nA lot is going to depend upon the purpose you're using it for.  If\nyou're using it descriptively, e.g. in history or anthropology, you'll\nprobably use definition 1 or 2.  If you're using it normatively, i.e.\nto say what you believe the Christian message is, you'll probably use\na definition like 3 or even 4.\n\n--clh]\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 8 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: dekorte@dirac.scri.fsu.edu (Stephen L.

However, your question\non \"asking Jesus to come into your heart\" seems to imply that infants\nare not allowed to have Christ in theirs.  Why must Baptism always be\nviewed by some people as a sort of \"prodigal son\" type of thing; i.e. a\nsudden change of heart, going from not accepting Christ to suddenly\naccepting Christ?  Why can't people start out with Christ from shortly\nafter birth, and build their relationship from there?  After all, does\na man suddenly meet a woman, and then marry her that same day?

In fact, there is substantial evidence\n(Skarda, 1985; Skarda & Freeman 1987) that brains work more or less\nchaotically, generating enough randomness for mental states to evolve.\nOur brains work much like genetic algorithm generators, I suppose.\n\n> the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered.

I suggest, however, that before trying to\nunderstand our consciousness as a collection of algorithms. \n\nKevin, take a look at the references I mentioned, and think again.\nI still think the best experts on the nature of a conscious mind\nare neurologists, neuropsychologists and biologists (but do not \nflame me for my opinions), since they study beings that are\nconscious. \n\nThe reason I am repeating my advice is that this discussion cannot\nlead to anywhere if our backgrounds are too different.\n\nAnd please, do not bring QM into this discussion at all - not\nall physicists are happy with the claim that our consciousness\nplays some special role in physics. I would say it doesn't.\n\n> The other problem with algorithms is their instability.

Don't forget this. This does not\nmean they need something else to work - they just work differently.\nTheir primary 'purpose' is perception and guidance of action, \nself-awareness and high intelligence are later appearances.\n\n> The next problem is the sticky question of \"What is colour?\" (replace\n> 'colour' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, the\n> materialist viewpoint is that it's the product of some kind of\n> chemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy +\n> different chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these?\n\nYou are still expecting that we could find the idea of 'green' in\nour brains somewhere, perhaps in the form of some chemical. This is\nnot how I see it. The sensation 'green' is a certain time-dependent\npattern in the area V4 of our visual cortex, and it is distributed\nwith the help of areas V1 and V2 to the rest of the brain. \n\nIndeed, a firing pattern. I have sometimes thought of our consciousness\nas a global free induction pattern of these local firing patterns,\nbut this is just idle speculation.\n\nScientific American's September 1992 issue was a special issue on\nmind and brain. Have you already read it from cover to cover? ;-)\nThere are two articles on visual perception, so you might be \ninterested.\n\nBut again, please note that subjective experiences cannot be \nobserved from a third-person perspective. If we see nothing but \nneuronal activity, we cannot go on to conclude that this is not the\nmind.\n\nKalat (1988) writes about numerous examples where electric stimulation\nof different areas of brain have led to various changes in the \npatients' state of mind. For instance, a patient whose septal area\nwas stimulated (without his knowledge) by remote control during\na psychiatric interview was quickly cured of his depression, and\nstarted discussing a plan to seduce his girlfriend.\n\nStimulations in the temporal lobe have sometimes led to embarrassing\nsituations, when the patients have started flirting with the\ntherapist.\n\nIn conclusion, there is evidence that\n\n1) brains are essentially necessary for subjective experiences, \n   brain damage is usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage\n\n2) conscious processes involve substantial brain activity in\n   various areas of brain - when we think of colours, our\n   visual cortex is activated etc.\n\n3) consciousness is an afterthought - we become conscious of our\n   actions with a half a second delay, and our brains are ahead\n   of our 'conscious will' by at least 350 ms. \n\nThus, I think it is fruitful to turn the question \"Why do 'I' see\ncolours\" around and ask \"What is this 'I' that seems to be \nobserving?\", since it seems that our conscious mind is not\nthe king of our brains.\n\n> If this is so, a\n> computer won't see colour, because the chemistry is different.

Does a neural\nnetwork that is capable of recognising handwritten numbers from\n0 to 9 see the numbers, if it is capable of sorting them?\n\nIf you are asking, \"why does an animal who is conscious of itself\nas an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal who\ndoesn't\", I have a good answer - read my previous posting,\nwhere I wrote why a sense of identity helps social animals to swap\nroles and act more morally, so that they don't unconsciously\nkill each other with newly discovered weapons. (A bit extreme,\nbut this is the basic idea.)\n\nWhen early _Homo_ became more and more efficient in using tools, \na sense of identity and the concept of 'self' had to evolve in\nline with this development. Indeed, respect for others and \nconscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantages\nfor social animals, such as early humans. \n\n> If I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction,\n> with two processes acting on it.

Dr. James DeYoung; #3]\n\nR. Scroggs\n\n     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and\nsuggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a\n\"Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic\nterminology.\"  The term is derived from Lev 18\"22 & 20:13 where the LXX\njuxtaposes the two words arsenos (\"male\") and koiten (\"bed\"), and represents\nthe Hebrew miskab zabar (\"lying with a male\").   Yet he believes that Paul did\nnot originate the term, but borrowed it from \"circles of Hellenistic Jews\nacquainted with rabbinic discussions\" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid\n\"contact with the usual Greek terminology\" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs\nobserves, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions\nof pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to\nnative-speaking Greeks (108).\n\n     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the\nobject of the second part, thus differing from Boswell's \"learned discussion\"\n(107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of \"one who lies with a\nmale\" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9),\nwhich Scroggs interprets as \"the effeminate call-boy,\" arsenokoitai is the\nactive partner \"who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress' or who hires him on\noccasion to satisfy his sexual desires\" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not\nrefer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic\nmodel of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he\naffirms (109).\n     This is Scrogg's interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The\ncombination of pornoi (\"fornicators\"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai (\"slave\ndealers\") refers to \"male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave\ndealers [who procure them]\" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of\npederasty \"which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual\npurposes, and the use of these boys by adult males\" (121).  Even \"serious\nminded pagan authors\" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these\ninstances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently\ngeneral condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. \nConsequently Paul \"Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind\" (122).\nWe cannot know what Paul would have said about the \"contemporary model of\nadult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships\" (122).\n\n     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical\nconcerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of\nvices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and\nfunction of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any\nrelationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually\nnonexistent.  He concludes that Paul \"does not care about any specific item in\nthe lists\" (104). \n\n     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary\nphenomenon of a \"catalogue of vices,\"  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are\n\"irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today\" (129).  The \"model\nin today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model\nattacked by the NT\" that \"Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not\nrelevant to today's debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational\ndiscussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify\nrefusal of ordination. . . \" (127).\n\n      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI\n\nD. Wright\n\n     In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have\ncome under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell's\nview is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out\nseveral shortcomings of Boswell's treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults\nBoswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev\n18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the \"Apostolic\nConstitutions,\"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). \nBoswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term\nderives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This\nis significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell's\nclaim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the\ngender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean \"a male who sleeps with\na male,\" making arseno- the object.\n\n     Wright also faults Boswell's claims regarding linguistic features of the\nterm, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that\ncompounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it\nas an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely\none of dialectical diversity: \"No semantic import attaches to the difference\nbetween the two forms\" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which\nthe second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its\nobject and where \"the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its\ngender\" (132). \n\n     It is with Boswell's treatment of the early church fathers that Wright\ntakes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. \nFor example, Aristides' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis,\nandrobaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male\nhomosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell's discussion.  Boswell fails to cite\nHippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the\nSyriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to\nthe Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34). \n\n     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in\nparallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the\ndominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this\nparallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia (\"adultery\"), porneia\n(\"fornication\"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris\n(136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the\nTen Commandments as \"You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis (\"you shall not commit\nadultery\"), ou paidophthoreseis (\"you shall not practice homosexuality with\nboys\"), you shall not steal. . .\" (150 n. 43).\n\n     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein (\"commit homosexuality\") exists in the\nSibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was\ncoined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by\nOr.Sib., book 2 (137-38).\n\n     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew\nupon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John\nthe Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of\nhomosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.\n\n     Wright next replies to Boswell's contention that the term would not be\nabsent \"from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted\n(140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to\nthe first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used\ndozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g.\nDidache) show no acquaintance with Paul's letters or deliberately avoid citing\nScripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). \n\n     Boswell's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright's attention\n(141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom,\nomitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a\nlong uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom\n1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom's infrequent use of the term.  Wright\nobserves that Boswell has \"signally failed to demonstrate any us of\narsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual\nactivity\" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature\nand the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly\nspecified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world. \n\n     Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim\nand I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning\n\"homosexual\" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of\nthe word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell's limited\nconclusion based on them.\n\n     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the\ncatalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed\nin late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of\nhomosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the\npart of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into\nbeing under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke \"generally of\nmale activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual\nengagement with paides\" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were\ninterchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).\n\n     In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning\nhomosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and\nothers who limit the term to \"active male prostitutes\" or pederasty are without\nsignificant support from linguistic and historical studies.  \n\n[Next: the questioning of Wrights position by William Peterson.  After that, we\nget into the \"good\" stuff of historical & linguistic studies.  THis will\ninclude \"Symposium\" by Plato.  If there is any doubt as to the modern\nunderstanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time of\nPaul, this will certainly clear things up.  Also we will review Paul's use of\nLev18-20 in the NT and how, as for him, 1) the Law was fulfilled, but not done\naway with, 2) Lev 18-20 was the universal and the following chapters the\ngeneral.  Those who put forth that the OT no longer holds true today in our\nculture, should stick around for this one.]\n___________________________\n13 R. Scroggs, THe New Testament and Homosexuality (Phil: 1983) 86, 107-8. \nIndependently we came to the same conclusion.  Apparently the connection is\nmade in E.A. Sophocles, Greek Lexicon of the Roman & Byzantine Periods (from\n146BC to AD 1100).\n14   See discussion, 101-4.  He says the same thing about Paul's language in\nRom 1:26-27 (128).  But this is doubtful.  See the more cautious words of P.\nZaas, \"I Cor 6.9ff: Was Homosexuality Condoned in the Corinthian Church? SBLASP\n17 (1979):205-12.  He observes that the words moixai, malakoi, and arsenokoitai\nwere part of Jewish anti-Gentile polemic.  Yet Paul's wors at the end of the\nvice list, \"and such were some of you,\" indicate that \"Paul is addressing real\nor potential abuses of his ethical message, not citing primitive tradition by\nrote\" (210).  Wright disputes Zaas' attempt to associate the term with idolatry\n(147).\n15  On Boswell's treatment of Rom 1:26-7, the article by R.B. Hays, \"Relations\nNatural and Unnatural\"  A Response to John Boswell's Exegesis of Romans 1,\" JRE\n14/1 (Spring 1986): 184-215, is an excellent critique.\n16  D.F. Wright, \"Homosexuals or Prostitutes?  The Meaning of ARSENOKOITAI (I\nCor 6:9, I Tim 1:10), VC 38 (1984):125-53.\n17  In an unpublished paper, Henry Mendell, \"ARSENOKOITAI: Boswell on Paul,\"\neffectively refutres Boswell's claims regarding the philology of arsenokoitai. \nHe finds the meaning to be general, \"a male who has sex with a male\" (4-11).  \n18  Wright's endnotes (148-49) list additional sources in the church fathers.\n19   We also have noticed the same tendency by Boswell to fail to cite all the\nreferences to Sodom and sodomy in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha.  See  J.B.\nDeYoung, \"A Critique of Prohomosexual Interpretations of the OT Apocrypha and\nPseudepigrapha,\" BSac 146/588 (1990):437-53.\n20   In light of the claim made by Boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitai\npoints to a meaning lacking homosexual significance, Wright asks pertinently\n\"why neither Philo nor Josephus use  paidofthoria, nor Josephus paiderastia,\nand why . . Clement did not use the latter and Chrysostom the former?\"  (152 n.\n71)  In a more recent article, \"Homosexuality: The Relevance of the Bible,\" EvQ\n61 (1989):291-300, Wright reiterates these same points.

A day after I finally found out my faith is over,\nI decided to try just one more time. The same cycle of emotional\nresponses fired once again, but this time the delusion lasted only\na couple of hours.

Dan, many UFO stories are much better\ndocumented than the resurrection of Jesus. The resurrection is documented\nquite haphazardly in the Bible - it seems the authors did not pay too\nmuch attention to which wild rumour to leave out. Besides, the ends of\nthe gospels probably contain later additions and insertions; for instance,\nthe end of Mark (16:9-20) is missing from many early texts, says my Bible.\n\nJesus may have lived and died, but he was probably misunderstood.\n\n> As much\n> as anything else you learn.

A generation\nbefore the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh,\ngateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather\nthan God's way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which would\nhave given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored their\ndecision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the\nland of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision-\nmakers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and\ndestined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the\ntime they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderers\nhad been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with a\nsigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they\nwere going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence.\nWhatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached\nbones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression of\nhopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nation\nat Kadesh and had God' s promise of one day entering the land. The\nforty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, those\nwho were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the\ninheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Moses\nprays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over.\nAll these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining\npeople through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden.\nHis was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but\nhe also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem was\nthat they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. \"Who is your\nGod?\" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. When\nAaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or young\nbull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bull\nwho had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt's gods as He led\nIsrael to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles grow\nthin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and water\ngushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the\nGod of Almightiness becomes \"ho-hum --What' s next on the miracle menu?\"\nAnd a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He might\nbe all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a right\nto do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these people\nhad known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men's lives had hung\non the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believed\nGod could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIM\nand, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, His\nacts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From the\nday of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God.\nAt Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. He\nhad seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. This\nrequest was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God's glorious\nPerson. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and\nlovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word \"lovingkindness\" is not to be\nunderstood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationship\narising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as the\nlove that says, \"I will never leave you nor forsake you.\" Lovingkindness is as\ntenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its\nheels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based on\nfeelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and,\ntherefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God's love is not an emotion\nthat wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our\nhighest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. God\ndoes not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings\nof love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with\nus! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Him\nto reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- not\nbecause of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committed\nto us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He will\nnot let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us--\nbut a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It is\nsaying to the recipient, \"For as long as we shall live, I am for you.\"  The God\nwho has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--in\nHis coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who is\nlovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will never\nleave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him as\nlove; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeing\nmiracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in the\nheart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power.\nMoses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had for\nthese people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, they\ncould not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born out\nof knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One who\ngives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is to\nmiss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  If\nman is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on\nknowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues from\nlove demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years of\nmeaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to\nknow the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and the\npossibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. The\nlanguage Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its\nmother's love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It is\nwaking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for,\nprotected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we were\nto ask, \"What has the baby done to deserve this?\" or, \"Have arrangements\nbeen made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?\" Our\nquestions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child was\nconceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love's excitement, a love\nthat has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents' love is\nunconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child\nor its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally,\nspontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after\nHis image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the\nLord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to\nearn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identity\nthrough the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents' love. It is a\nscientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if\nit survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has been\nheld and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the\nembrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the new\ngeneration will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in\nthe love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and\ngladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His\nlove. \"Satisfied.\" in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing\nbeing filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describe\nthe earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received\nenough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be\ndrenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is the\nlifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in our\ndeepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems\ndisappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling\nthat he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make\nsense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks this\nsatisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the\nemotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in\nreligious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding\nto the love of the living God. Only in knowing God's love will the rest of life\nmake sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again\nbecame the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find it\nfascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His\nlove. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one would\nthink he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by\nthe knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knew\nbetter. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won't\nfind it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to\nmanipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and\ngive us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyes\nand satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking God\nto make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses' prayer was partially\nanswered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which\nworked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in its\nfullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out the\nlove of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church,\nwe read of the Holy Spirit \"falling upon\" the believers. This is an ancient\nexpression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used in\nLuke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and \"falling on his\nneck and kissing him.\" The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest\nself and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your\nbeing. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes.\nMoses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization\nthat we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taught\nus to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in a\nstate of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance\nand love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive love\nwe cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the Holy\nSpirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness to\nthink on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jaded\nwith the doctrine of \"perform to be accepted.\" We begin to realize that He\nloves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challenge\neveryone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your\neyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may not\nfeel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed the\nother day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians kept\nbehind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rays\nwithout being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing\nthat we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according to\nMoses, \"joy and gladness all our days.\" Joy is the result of a life that is\nfunctioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might say\nthat joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. Man' s highest\nperformance is to rest in the love God has for him... the hum will be joy, and\nthe result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now\nhas in life. Stop wandering in the wilderness. Be satisfied with His love and,\nin joy, day by day, receive all His promised blessings.\n\n\n----- End Included Message -----\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 18 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: cobb@alexia.lis.uiuc.edu (Mike Cobb)\nSubject: Science and theories\nOrganization: University of Illinois at Urbana\nLines: 19\n\nAs per various threads on science and creationism, I've started dabbling into a\nbook called Christianity and the Nature of Science by JP Moreland.

STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC\n\n\tYour natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to\npanic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get right\nwith God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your \nonly chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the \nTribulation.  \"But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be \nsaved.\" - Matthew 24:13\n\nII. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION\n\n\tThe Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of\nthe rapture until Christ's second coming.  Also know as \"the time of Jacob's\n(Israel's) trouble\" (Jere 30:7) and \"Daniel's Seventieth Week\" (Dan 9), this \nperiod will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.\n\nIII. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM\n\n\tSoon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community \n(the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will\nbe tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable \npossession during the Tribulation.\n\nIV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tSince all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it\nis imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can\nquote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, \nRevelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to\nunfold before you.  \n\nV. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tPray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray \nand pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual \nstrength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the\nsake of Christ.  \n\nVI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED\nONES DIE AS MARTYRS\n\n\tAfter the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he\nwill institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell,\nor eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be\nuseless.  \"And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and \nslave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that\nno one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, \nor the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding\ncalculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number\nis 666\" - Revelation 13:16-18.  \n\tThe Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of \nhumanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed\nin the past, such as the Holocaust.\n[or maybe the crusades? -M]\nYou cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's\nrule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) \"...I saw\nunder the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and\nfor the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of \nthem: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, \nuntil both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be\nkilled as they were, was completed.\" Revelation 6:9, 11.\n\tHis targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image\nor take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ \"...And I saw the souls of \nthose who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of \nGod, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark\non their foreheads or on the hands.\" - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every\nform of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor\nwill he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, \ntorturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take\nthe mark.  \n\tIf you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,\nyou will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.\n[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]\nYou cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and\ngain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake\nof Fire.  \"...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his \nmark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of\nthe wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His \nindignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the \npresence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.\" -Revelation \n14:9-10 \n\n[and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to\nthe first 5,000 at the stadium --M] \n\nVII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL\n\n\tAlthough you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist's government\nuntil the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is \nimportant for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are\nextremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.\n\tThe first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or\nmountainous area, for the Antichrist's control will come last to the least\npopulated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay \nattuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.\n[\"As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep\ninto our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school\nclosings\" --M] \nStore water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without\nthe mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste\nfrom nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.\n[Get a good water filter. --M]\nBring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,\nbatteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to \nsurvive and live off the land as the pioneers did.\n\nVIII. TRUST NO ONE\n\t\n\tThere will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist's\ngovernment.  Be on the lookout.\n[Perot supporters take note --M]\n\nIX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST\n\n\tIt is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,\nfor he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will\nbring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel \n11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a\nhalf years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be \nphysically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and \npersonality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic\nexpert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which\nhe will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural \npower that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will\nbe deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.\n[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]\n\tThe antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who\nwill make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  \nAll who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and\na half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.\n\nX. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!\n\n\tThe seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of\nChrist.  The Antichrist will be defeated.

And such were \n>some of you...\"  I Cor. 6:9-11.\n\nThe moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_\nin this.  I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of\nactivity that could be named by \"fornication\" or \"theft\" or \"coveting\" or\n\"reviling\" or \"drunkenness\" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may\nor may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very\nfact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at\nall \"clear\" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest\nin MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,\nwith all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated\nChristian discussion of ALL these areas.\n\nHomosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I\nknow) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and\nchild molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly\n\"harmless\" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --\nthat would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter\nyou cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that\nyou want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]\n\n\t\"'I am free to do anything,' you say.  Yes, but not everything\n\tis for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one\n\twill not let anything make free with me.\"  [1 Cor. 6:12]\n\nWhich is a restatement that we must have no other \"god\" before God.  A\ncommandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some\npeople are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.\nIt is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary\nargument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such\nbehavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers.\n\nI won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.\nFundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your\nassumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of\nlaws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of\nwhich Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine\nthem.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are \"moral\" and\nwhich ones are \"ritual.\"  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology\ncourse should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories\nin an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).\nAnd I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus\nfrom the \"ritual law\" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.\n\nI'm dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this\nmatter) about how \"repulsive\" and \"unnatural\" our acts are -- and what\ndo they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of\narbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating\ninsects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you\nsay that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part\nof the ritual law?\n\nFor those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\nbe \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\nit is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\ndetermine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the\nwhole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: \"No doubt I am free to do anything.\"\nBut Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,\nthe Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go\nthrough Leviticus and decide each \"command\" there on that basis, then\nyour own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this\ncontext, it is remarkably offensive to say:\n\n>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the\n>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.\n\nWell, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the\none that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously\n(though one can always find jokers) in \"defense\" of bestiality.  It is\nabsolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\nraise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\nadult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\nthan the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you\nare being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the\nworld.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not\nmine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in\nour culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing\nus as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means\nyou can think of to do so.\n\nJesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,\nthe central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to\nlove one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-\nians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get\nin return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.\n\nChristians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every\ncorner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same\nold verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never\neven read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with\nthe vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\nmanage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great\nemotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even\ntaking the trouble to find out what it is.\n\nSuch behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.\nWHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to\ncondemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN\nto BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?\nGod forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or\ncondemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in\ninsisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are\nSO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.\n\nWhy, for God's sake?\n\n\t\"For God did not send the Son into the world\n\tto condemn the world,\n\tbut that the world might be saved through him.\n\tWhoever believes in him is not condemned,\n\tbut whoever does not believe has already been condemned\n\tfor refusing to believe in the name of God's only Son.\n\tNow the judgment is this:\n\tthe light has come into the world,\n\tbut men have preferred darkness to light\n\tbecause their deeds were evil.\n\tFor everyone who practices wickedness\n\thates the light,\n\tand does not come near the light\n\tfor fear his deeds will be exposed.\n\tBut he who acts in truth\n\tcomes into the light,\n\tso that it may be sh0own\n\tthat his deeds are done in God.\"\tJohn 3:17-21\n\nFor long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from\nevil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and\nrejected.

A week ago, I managed to find time to consult\na Septuagint Concordance and a LXX text with apparatus at the library,\nand I can now usefully conclude my look at the Greek words for love as\nused in the Christian background of the Septuagintal translation of the\nJewish scriptures.\n\nThe principal result is that there is a cluster of uses of the verbal\nnoun from _erao:_, _eraste:s_ meaning \"lover.\"  This cluster occurs just\nwhere one might most expect it, in the propethic image (and accusation)\nof Israel as faithless spouse to YHWH.  The verses in question are Hosea\n2:5,7 & 10; Jeremiah 4:30, 22:20 & 22; Lamentations 1:19; and Ezekiel\n16:33, 36 &37 and 23:5, 9 & 22.\n\n\t[ Hosea seems to have originated this usage, which Jeremiah and\n\t  Ezekiel picked up;  Lamentations is dependent on, though not\n\t  likely written by, Jeremiah. ]\n\nThe \"erotic\" meaning (in its allegorical use, not at all literally) is\nevident.  So too in English, unless you complement it with a phrase like\n\"of the arts\" the word \"lover\" is going to have an overtone of sexual\nrelationship.  There is no surprise here, but it is worthwhile to see\nthat standard Greek usage *does* show up in the translations from the\nHebrew! :-)\n\nMore interestingly, and some confirmation of my guess that later Koine\nusage avoided the verb _erao:_ because of its homonymy to _ero:_ (say),\n_eromai_ (ask), there is an error in Codex Vaticanus (normally, a very\nvaluable witness) where a form of _erao:_ is used in a completely absurd\ncontext -- 2 Samuel 20:18, where the  meaning *must* be \"say.\"\n\nIn addition to the above (and the uses I have already mentioned in Proverbs),\nEsther 2:17 uses the verb in its most natural application, \n\n\tkai e:rasthe\" ho basileus Esthe:r  --  and the King loved Esther\n\nand, rather more interestingly, 1 Samuel 19:2 supplies a modest degree of\nsupport to the gay appraisal of the relationship of David and Jonathan:\n\n\tkai Io:nathan huios Saoul e:[i]reito ton Dauid sphodra\n\t-- and Jonathan, Saul's son, loved David intensely\n\n\t[ I'm using the bracketed [i] for io:ta subscript, which I\n\t  don't yet have a reasonable ASCII convention for. ]\n\n(The relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about\nthe \"historical\" facts, but just that a quasi-official translation of\nthe Hebrew text in the Hellenistic period makes no bones about using the\n\"erotic\" verb in this context.  Given the quite general usage of _agapao:_\nfor erotic senses, this need not mean anything \"more\" than _agapao:_ alone\nwould mean, but it DOES disambiguate the relationship, as far as this\ntranslator goes!)\n-- \nMichael L.

He gave references to all his\nconclusions and as I have stated, for the last 25 years I have used his\nconclusions in debates at RC seminaries and brotherhoods, not to mention the\nindividual priests and bishops that I have talked to one on one.  No counter to\nHislops scholarship was made.  The only rebuttals were against his conclusions\nbecause they do totally undermined the claims of the RCC. He was showing that\nthe intitution of the RCC was based on the mysteries (which others have shown\neven to this day in various articles and topics).  THe tongues movement in\nCorinth was a direct result of the mysteries entering into the church.  If it\nwas so in Corinth, why could they not have an influence in Rome, the city of\nseven hills?\n\nAlso, you do not have to listen to his conclusions, you can draw your own\nconclusions by looking at the customs, artifacts, the cerimonial dress, the\ndocrine of purgatory, etc from the vantage of the mysteries.

Does it have pagan history behind it, and if so,\nwhy did the RCC chose regardless?\n\nAny lay person of middle eastern religion can answer these questions.

The teacher of the class is what I consider to be\nclosed-minded and bigotted on the subject of what the definition of\nChristianity is.  His definition is tied directly to that of the\nTrinity and the Catholic church's definition of it and belief in\nJesus Christ is not sufficient to call one's self a Christian.\n\nWhile his saying it doesn't make it so,  I nevertheless feel insulted\n(or am I just neurotic? :^) ). I would like to be able to respond to\nhim with some sense of literacy while maintaining an amiable\nstudent-teacher relationship.\n\nSo, is there common definition of what Christianity is?  As the\nprevious discussion of the Trinity did not lend itself to an exchange\nof flames, I am hopeful that this will also not produce major\nflames.\n\nRegards,\n--\nLarry Autry\nSilicon Graphics, St. Louis\nautry@sgi.com \n\n\n\n[Often we get into discussions about who is Christian.  Unfortunately\nthere are a number of possible definitions.  Starting from the \nbroadest, commonly used definitions are:\n\n  a historical definition\n  people who accept Christ as Lord and savior\n  a broad doctrinal definition\n  narrow doctrinal definitions\n\n1) By a historical definition I mean the sort of definition a secular\nhistorian would likely use.  This would include any group that\ndeveloped out of the Christian church, and continues within the same\nbroad culture.  E.g. some Unitarians would fail just about any\ndoctrinal test you could come up with.  Yet it's clear that that group\ndeveloped from Christianity, and people from very different\nbackgrounds (e.g. Hindus) would likely see them as part of\nChristianity.  This is not a definition most Christians like, but it's\nrelevant in some political and ethnic contexts.\n\n2) Accepting Christ as Lord and savior is a test used by many\nChristian groups for membership, e.g. the Southern Baptists and\nPresbyterian Church (USA).  I would qualify it by saying that what\nmost people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to Christ, so that\nsomeone who accepted Christ as one of many gods would not fit.  It's\nan attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not based\non technical doctrine.  By this definition, groups such as Arians\nwould be viewed as heretical Christians, but still Christians.  In the\nmodern context this would include Mormons, JW's, and \"oneness\nPentecostals\".  They would be viewed as heretical Christians, but\nstill Christian.  In practice I believe just about everyone who falls\ninto this category would accept the Apostle's Creed.\n\n3) The next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition,\nwhich includes all of the major strands of Christianity, but excludes\ngroups that are felt to be outside \"historic Christianity.\"  This is\nof course a slippery enterprise, since Catholics could argue that\nProtestants are outside historic Christianity, etc.  But I think the\nmost commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the\nNicene Creed and the Formula of Chalcedon.  The attempt is to\ncharacterize doctrines that all major strands of Christianity agree\nare key.  Obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement.  A\nMormon will regard the LDS church as a major strand, and thus will not\nwant to include anything that contradicts their beliefs.  But I think\nthis definition would have fairly broad acceptance.\n\n4) Finally, some people use definitions that I would say are limited\nto a specific Christian tradition.  E.g. some evangelicals only\nconsider someone Christian if he has had an evangelical-style\nconversion experience, and some I've even heard of groups that limit\nit to their specific church.\n\nI think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used.\nA lot is going to depend upon the purpose you're using it for.  If\nyou're using it descriptively, e.g. in history or anthropology, you'll\nprobably use definition 1 or 2.  If you're using it normatively, i.e.\nto say what you believe the Christian message is, you'll probably use\na definition like 3 or even 4.\n\n--clh]\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 8 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: Alan.Olsen@p17.f40.n105.z1.fidonet.org (Alan Olsen)\nSubject: After 2000 years, can we say that Christian Morality is\nLines: 29\n\n\nMC> Theory of Creationism: MY theistic view of the theory of\nMC> creationism, (there  are many others) is stated in Genesis\nMC> 1.

The founder of this\nmovement, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), was proclaimed to \nbe the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in the Scriptures\nof almost all major religions of the world. He claimed to be the \nfulfillment of the long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ\n(metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah.\n\n        The claims of Hazrat Ahmad raised storms of hostility and\nextreme opposition, which are often witnessed in the history of \ndivine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted especial-\nly in some of the Muslim regimes. The right of Ahmadi Muslims to \nopenly practice their religion and to define themselves as Muslims\nhas been severely restricted in many Muslim Countries. The United\nNations, human rights organizations such as Amnesty International\nand top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns \nagainst this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the\nmembers of this movement, but so far to no avail.\n\n        Despite the opposition and persecution, the movement cont-\ninues to grow with a current membership of millions from around the\nworld in over 130 countries, who come from diverse ethnic and cul-\ntural backgrounds.\n\n        The movement is devoted to world peace and strives towards\ndeveloping a better understanding of all religions. Ahmadi Muslims\nhave always been opposed to all forms of violence, bigotry, reli-\ngious intolerance and fundamentalism.\n\n        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-\ntablished a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clinics\nin many third world countries. These institutions are staffed by\nvolunteer professionals and are fully financed by the movement's\ninternal resources. The movement stresses the importance of educa-\ntion and leadership. Its members have included a high number of\nprofessionals as well as world class individuals.\n\n        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral\nreform, establish peace and justice, and to unite mankind under\none universal brotherhood.\n\n\nNEWSGROUP CREATION: \n==================\n\n        The  discussion for this proposed newsgroup has now offi-\ncially ended. Voting will be held for three weeks. If the news-\ngroup gets 2/3rd majority AND 100 more \"YES/Create\" votes than\n\"NO/don't create\" votes; the newsgroup shall be created. \n\n\nABOUT THE VOTE-TAKER: \n====================\n\n        Mr. Anthony Lest has been asked by the proponents of\nthis newsgroup to act as an official impartial vote-taker for the\nproposed newsgroup.

However, your question\non \"asking Jesus to come into your heart\" seems to imply that infants\nare not allowed to have Christ in theirs.  Why must Baptism always be\nviewed by some people as a sort of \"prodigal son\" type of thing; i.e. a\nsudden change of heart, going from not accepting Christ to suddenly\naccepting Christ?  Why can't people start out with Christ from shortly\nafter birth, and build their relationship from there?  After all, does\na man suddenly meet a woman, and then marry her that same day?  From my\nexperiences, I've learned that all relationships must be built,\nincluding one's relationship with God.\n\n   Also Joe is speaking from the standpoint that Baptism is not just a\nritual, but that through it God bestows sacramental grace upon the\nrecipient.  Certainly for those with the mental faculties to know Christ\nit is necessary to believe in Him.  However, the Sacrament itself\nbestows grace on the recipient, and makes a permanent mark of adoption\ninto God's family on the soul.\n\n-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\nSteve Creps, Indiana University\ncreps@lateran.ucs.indiana.edu\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 10 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: kadie@cs.uiuc.edu (Carl M Kadie)\nSubject: [UPI] \"Mother files complaint over Boy Scouts\"\nKeywords: children, special interest, gambling, human interest, \tchildren's education, education\nOrganization: University of Illinois, Dept. of Comp.

Dr. James DeYoung; #3]\n\nR. Scroggs\n\n     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and\nsuggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a\n\"Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic\nterminology.\"  The term is derived from Lev 18\"22 & 20:13 where the LXX\njuxtaposes the two words arsenos (\"male\") and koiten (\"bed\"), and represents\nthe Hebrew miskab zabar (\"lying with a male\").   Yet he believes that Paul did\nnot originate the term, but borrowed it from \"circles of Hellenistic Jews\nacquainted with rabbinic discussions\" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid\n\"contact with the usual Greek terminology\" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs\nobserves, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions\nof pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to\nnative-speaking Greeks (108).\n\n     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the\nobject of the second part, thus differing from Boswell's \"learned discussion\"\n(107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of \"one who lies with a\nmale\" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9),\nwhich Scroggs interprets as \"the effeminate call-boy,\" arsenokoitai is the\nactive partner \"who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress' or who hires him on\noccasion to satisfy his sexual desires\" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not\nrefer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic\nmodel of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he\naffirms (109).\n     This is Scrogg's interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The\ncombination of pornoi (\"fornicators\"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai (\"slave\ndealers\") refers to \"male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave\ndealers [who procure them]\" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of\npederasty \"which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual\npurposes, and the use of these boys by adult males\" (121).  Even \"serious\nminded pagan authors\" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these\ninstances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently\ngeneral condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. \nConsequently Paul \"Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind\" (122).\nWe cannot know what Paul would have said about the \"contemporary model of\nadult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships\" (122).\n\n     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical\nconcerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of\nvices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and\nfunction of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any\nrelationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually\nnonexistent.  He concludes that Paul \"does not care about any specific item in\nthe lists\" (104). \n\n     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary\nphenomenon of a \"catalogue of vices,\"  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are\n\"irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today\" (129).  The \"model\nin today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model\nattacked by the NT\" that \"Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not\nrelevant to today's debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational\ndiscussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify\nrefusal of ordination. . . \" (127).\n\n      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI\n\nD. Wright\n\n     In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have\ncome under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell's\nview is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out\nseveral shortcomings of Boswell's treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults\nBoswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev\n18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the \"Apostolic\nConstitutions,\"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). \nBoswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term\nderives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This\nis significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell's\nclaim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the\ngender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean \"a male who sleeps with\na male,\" making arseno- the object.\n\n     Wright also faults Boswell's claims regarding linguistic features of the\nterm, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that\ncompounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it\nas an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely\none of dialectical diversity: \"No semantic import attaches to the difference\nbetween the two forms\" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which\nthe second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its\nobject and where \"the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its\ngender\" (132). \n\n     It is with Boswell's treatment of the early church fathers that Wright\ntakes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. \nFor example, Aristides' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis,\nandrobaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male\nhomosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell's discussion.  Boswell fails to cite\nHippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the\nSyriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to\nthe Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34). \n\n     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in\nparallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the\ndominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this\nparallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia (\"adultery\"), porneia\n(\"fornication\"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris\n(136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the\nTen Commandments as \"You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis (\"you shall not commit\nadultery\"), ou paidophthoreseis (\"you shall not practice homosexuality with\nboys\"), you shall not steal. . .\" (150 n. 43).\n\n     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein (\"commit homosexuality\") exists in the\nSibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was\ncoined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by\nOr.Sib., book 2 (137-38).\n\n     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew\nupon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John\nthe Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of\nhomosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.\n\n     Wright next replies to Boswell's contention that the term would not be\nabsent \"from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted\n(140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to\nthe first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used\ndozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g.\nDidache) show no acquaintance with Paul's letters or deliberately avoid citing\nScripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). \n\n     Boswell's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright's attention\n(141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom,\nomitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a\nlong uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom\n1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom's infrequent use of the term.  Wright\nobserves that Boswell has \"signally failed to demonstrate any us of\narsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual\nactivity\" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature\nand the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly\nspecified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world. \n\n     Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim\nand I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning\n\"homosexual\" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of\nthe word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell's limited\nconclusion based on them.\n\n     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the\ncatalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed\nin late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of\nhomosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the\npart of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into\nbeing under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke \"generally of\nmale activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual\nengagement with paides\" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were\ninterchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).\n\n     In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning\nhomosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and\nothers who limit the term to \"active male prostitutes\" or pederasty are without\nsignificant support from linguistic and historical studies.  \n\n[Next: the questioning of Wrights position by William Peterson.  After that, we\nget into the \"good\" stuff of historical & linguistic studies.  THis will\ninclude \"Symposium\" by Plato.  If there is any doubt as to the modern\nunderstanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time of\nPaul, this will certainly clear things up.  Also we will review Paul's use of\nLev18-20 in the NT and how, as for him, 1) the Law was fulfilled, but not done\naway with, 2) Lev 18-20 was the universal and the following chapters the\ngeneral.  Those who put forth that the OT no longer holds true today in our\nculture, should stick around for this one.]\n___________________________\n13 R. Scroggs, THe New Testament and Homosexuality (Phil: 1983) 86, 107-8. \nIndependently we came to the same conclusion.  Apparently the connection is\nmade in E.A. Sophocles, Greek Lexicon of the Roman & Byzantine Periods (from\n146BC to AD 1100).\n14   See discussion, 101-4.  He says the same thing about Paul's language in\nRom 1:26-27 (128).  But this is doubtful.  See the more cautious words of P.\nZaas, \"I Cor 6.9ff: Was Homosexuality Condoned in the Corinthian Church? SBLASP\n17 (1979):205-12.  He observes that the words moixai, malakoi, and arsenokoitai\nwere part of Jewish anti-Gentile polemic.  Yet Paul's wors at the end of the\nvice list, \"and such were some of you,\" indicate that \"Paul is addressing real\nor potential abuses of his ethical message, not citing primitive tradition by\nrote\" (210).  Wright disputes Zaas' attempt to associate the term with idolatry\n(147).\n15  On Boswell's treatment of Rom 1:26-7, the article by R.B. Hays, \"Relations\nNatural and Unnatural\"  A Response to John Boswell's Exegesis of Romans 1,\" JRE\n14/1 (Spring 1986): 184-215, is an excellent critique.\n16  D.F. Wright, \"Homosexuals or Prostitutes?  The Meaning of ARSENOKOITAI (I\nCor 6:9, I Tim 1:10), VC 38 (1984):125-53.\n17  In an unpublished paper, Henry Mendell, \"ARSENOKOITAI: Boswell on Paul,\"\neffectively refutres Boswell's claims regarding the philology of arsenokoitai. \nHe finds the meaning to be general, \"a male who has sex with a male\" (4-11).  \n18  Wright's endnotes (148-49) list additional sources in the church fathers.\n19   We also have noticed the same tendency by Boswell to fail to cite all the\nreferences to Sodom and sodomy in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha.  See  J.B.\nDeYoung, \"A Critique of Prohomosexual Interpretations of the OT Apocrypha and\nPseudepigrapha,\" BSac 146/588 (1990):437-53.\n20   In light of the claim made by Boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitai\npoints to a meaning lacking homosexual significance, Wright asks pertinently\n\"why neither Philo nor Josephus use  paidofthoria, nor Josephus paiderastia,\nand why . . Clement did not use the latter and Chrysostom the former?\"  (152 n.\n71)  In a more recent article, \"Homosexuality: The Relevance of the Bible,\" EvQ\n61 (1989):291-300, Wright reiterates these same points.  Paul shows a\n\"remarkable originality\" in extending the OT ethic to the church (300).\n\n \n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 12 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu (David Nye)\nSubject: Re: Faith and Dogma\nOrganization: University of Wisconsin Eau Claire\nLines: 28\n\n[reply to tgk@cs.toronto.edu (Todd Kelley)]\n \n>In light of what happened in Waco, I need to get something of my chest.\n \n>Faith and dogma are dangerous.\n \nAgreed.\n \n>A philosopher cannot be a Christian because a philosopher can change\n>his mind, whereas a Christian cannot, due to the nature of faith and\n>dogma present in any religion.\n \nIt is hard for me to understand, but quite a few professional scientists\nand philosophers are theists.\n \n>Sure, religion has many good qualities.

We have here the quintessential Christian: he sets up a\nsystem of values/beliefs for himself, which work very well, and every\nevent/experience is understandable and deablable within the framework of this\nsystem.  However, we also have an individual who has the inability (at least\nnot without some difficulty) to change, which is important, because the problem\nwith such a system is the same as with any system: one cannot be open minded to\nthe point of \"testing hypotheses\" against the basic premise of the system\nwithout destroying whatever faith is invested therein, unless of course, all\nthe tests fail.

A day after I finally found out my faith is over,\nI decided to try just one more time. The same cycle of emotional\nresponses fired once again, but this time the delusion lasted only\na couple of hours.

Dan, many UFO stories are much better\ndocumented than the resurrection of Jesus. The resurrection is documented\nquite haphazardly in the Bible - it seems the authors did not pay too\nmuch attention to which wild rumour to leave out. Besides, the ends of\nthe gospels probably contain later additions and insertions; for instance,\nthe end of Mark (16:9-20) is missing from many early texts, says my Bible.\n\nJesus may have lived and died, but he was probably misunderstood.\n\n> As much\n> as anything else you learn.

A generation\nbefore the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh,\ngateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather\nthan God's way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which would\nhave given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored their\ndecision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the\nland of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision-\nmakers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and\ndestined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the\ntime they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderers\nhad been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with a\nsigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they\nwere going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence.\nWhatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached\nbones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression of\nhopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nation\nat Kadesh and had God' s promise of one day entering the land. The\nforty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, those\nwho were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the\ninheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Moses\nprays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over.\nAll these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining\npeople through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden.\nHis was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but\nhe also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem was\nthat they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. \"Who is your\nGod?\" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. When\nAaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or young\nbull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bull\nwho had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt's gods as He led\nIsrael to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles grow\nthin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and water\ngushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the\nGod of Almightiness becomes \"ho-hum --What' s next on the miracle menu?\"\nAnd a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He might\nbe all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a right\nto do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these people\nhad known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men's lives had hung\non the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believed\nGod could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIM\nand, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, His\nacts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From the\nday of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God.\nAt Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. He\nhad seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. This\nrequest was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God's glorious\nPerson. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and\nlovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word \"lovingkindness\" is not to be\nunderstood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationship\narising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as the\nlove that says, \"I will never leave you nor forsake you.\" Lovingkindness is as\ntenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its\nheels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based on\nfeelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and,\ntherefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God's love is not an emotion\nthat wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our\nhighest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. God\ndoes not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings\nof love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with\nus! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Him\nto reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- not\nbecause of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committed\nto us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He will\nnot let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us--\nbut a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It is\nsaying to the recipient, \"For as long as we shall live, I am for you.\"  The God\nwho has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--in\nHis coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who is\nlovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will never\nleave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him as\nlove; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeing\nmiracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in the\nheart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power.\nMoses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had for\nthese people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, they\ncould not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born out\nof knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One who\ngives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is to\nmiss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  If\nman is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on\nknowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues from\nlove demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years of\nmeaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to\nknow the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and the\npossibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. The\nlanguage Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its\nmother's love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It is\nwaking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for,\nprotected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we were\nto ask, \"What has the baby done to deserve this?\" or, \"Have arrangements\nbeen made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?\" Our\nquestions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child was\nconceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love's excitement, a love\nthat has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents' love is\nunconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child\nor its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally,\nspontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after\nHis image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the\nLord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to\nearn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identity\nthrough the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents' love. It is a\nscientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if\nit survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has been\nheld and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the\nembrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the new\ngeneration will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in\nthe love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and\ngladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His\nlove. \"Satisfied.\" in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing\nbeing filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describe\nthe earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received\nenough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be\ndrenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is the\nlifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in our\ndeepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems\ndisappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling\nthat he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make\nsense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks this\nsatisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the\nemotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in\nreligious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding\nto the love of the living God. Only in knowing God's love will the rest of life\nmake sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again\nbecame the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find it\nfascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His\nlove. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one would\nthink he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by\nthe knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knew\nbetter. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won't\nfind it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to\nmanipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and\ngive us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyes\nand satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking God\nto make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses' prayer was partially\nanswered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which\nworked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in its\nfullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out the\nlove of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church,\nwe read of the Holy Spirit \"falling upon\" the believers. This is an ancient\nexpression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used in\nLuke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and \"falling on his\nneck and kissing him.\" The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest\nself and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your\nbeing. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes.\nMoses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization\nthat we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taught\nus to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in a\nstate of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance\nand love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive love\nwe cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the Holy\nSpirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness to\nthink on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jaded\nwith the doctrine of \"perform to be accepted.\" We begin to realize that He\nloves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challenge\neveryone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your\neyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may not\nfeel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed the\nother day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians kept\nbehind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rays\nwithout being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing\nthat we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according to\nMoses, \"joy and gladness all our days.\" Joy is the result of a life that is\nfunctioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might say\nthat joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. Man' s highest\nperformance is to rest in the love God has for him... the hum will be joy, and\nthe result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now\nhas in life. Stop wandering in the wilderness. Be satisfied with His love and,\nin joy, day by day, receive all His promised blessings.\n\n\n----- End Included Message -----\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 18 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: Alan.Olsen@p17.f40.n105.z1.fidonet.org (Alan Olsen)\nSubject: Albert Sabin\nLines: 275\n\n\n\nBR> From: wpr@atlanta.dg.com (Bill Rawlins)\nBR> Newsgroups: alt.atheism\nBR> Organization: DGSID, Atlanta, GA\n\nBR>        Since you have referred to the Messiah, I assume you\nBR> are referring         to the New Testament.

Mark and Luke speak of many far\noff, and Mark includes Mary Magdeline and Mary the mother of James the less.\nJohn says that Jesus's mother stood at the cross, along with her sister and\nMary Magdalene.\n\n>Jesus' last words \n\nMatt.27:46,50: \"And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, \nsaying, \"Eli, eli, lama sabachthani?\" that is to say, \"My God, my God, why\nhast thou forsaken me?\"  ...Jesus, when he cried again with a loud voice,\nyielded u the ghost.\"\n\nLuke23:46: \"And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, \"Father, unto\n thy hands I commend my spirit:\" and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.\"\n\nJohn19:30: \"When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, \"It is \nfinished:\" and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.\"\n\n>Events of the crucifiction\n\nMatthew says that the veil of the temple was rent, that there was an\nearthquake, and that it was dark from the sixth to the ninth hour, that graves\nopened and bodies of the saints arose and went into Jeruselem, appearing to\nmany (beating Jesus to the resurection). Mark and Luke speak of darkness and\nthe veil of the temple being rent but mention no earthquake or risen saints. \nJohn is the only one who mentions Jesus's side being peirced.\n\n>Burial of Jesus\n\nMatthew says the Jews asked Pilate for a guard to prevent the body from being\nstolen by the disciples, and for the tomb to be sealed. All of this was\nsupposedly done, but the other gospels do not mention these precautions.\n\n>How long was Jesus in the tomb?\nDepends where you look; Matthew 12:40 gives Jesus prophesying that he will\nspend \"three days and three nights in the heart of the earth\", and Mark 10:34\nhas \"after three days (meta treis emeras) he will rise again\". As far as I can\nsee from a quick look, the prophecies have \"after three days\", but the\npost-resurrection narratives have \"on the third day\".\n\n>Time of the Resurection\n\nMatthew says Sunday at dawn, Mark says the sun was rising, and John says it\nwas dark.\n\n> Who was at the Empty Tomb?  Is it :\n\nMAT 28:1  In the end of the sabbath, as it began to  dawn  toward the first\nday of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.\n\nMAR 16:1  And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the  mother \nof  James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and\nanoint him.\n\nJOH 20:1  The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene  early, when  it \nwas  yet  dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the\nsepulchre.\n\n>Whom did they see at the tomb?\n\nMAT 28:2  And, behold, there was  a  great  earthquake:  for  the angel of the\nLord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door,\nand sat upon it.\nMAT 28:3  His countenance was like  lightning,  and  his  raiment white as\nsnow: MAT 28:4  And for fear of him the keepers did shake,  and  became as\ndead men. MAT 28:5  And the angel answered and said unto  the  women,  Fear\nnot ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.\n\nMAR 16:5  And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a  young  man sitting  on \nthe right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.\n\nLUK 24:4  And it came  to  pass,  as  they  were  much  perplexed thereabout,\nbehold, two men stood by them in shining garments:\n\nJOH 20:12  And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at  the head,  and \nthe  other  at  the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.\n\n>Belief that the disciples stole Jesus's body\n\nMatthew says the guard was paid to tell this story, but no other gospel makes\nthis claim.\n\n>Appearences of the risen Jesus\n\nMatthew says an angel at the tomb told the two Marys and that Jesus also told\nthem, to tell the disciples to meet him in Galilee.  The disciples then went\nto a mountain previously agreed opon, and met Jesus there.  This was his only\nappearance, except to the women at the tomb.  Matthew only devotes five verses\nto the visit with the disciples.\n\nMark says that Jesus walked with two of the disciples in the country, and that\nthey told the rest of the disciples, who refused to believe.  Later he\nappeared to the 11 disciples at mealtime.\n\nLuke says two followers went, the same day that Jesus rose from the dead, to\nEmmaus, a village eight miles from Jeruselem, and there Jesus jioned them but\nwas unrecognised.  While they ate a meal together that evening, they finally\nrecognised Jesus, whereopon he dissapeared.  Returning at once to Jeruselem,\nthey told the\ndisciples of their experience, and suddenly Jesus appeared among them,\nfrightening them, as they thought he was a spirit.  Jesus then ate some fish\nand honey and then preached to them.\n\nJohn says Jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he arrose, in\nJeruselem, where they were hiding.  He breathed the Holy Ghost opon them, but\nThomas was not present and refused to believe. Eight days later Jesus joined\nthe disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced Thomas.\tOnce\nmore Jesus made an\nappearance to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias but again was not\nrecognised.\n After telling them to cast their netson the other side of the boat, Jesus\nbecomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them.  They all eat\ntogether and converse.\n\nThe book of acts further adds to the confusion.  It says that Jesus showed\nhimself to the apostles for a period of 40 days after his resurection (thus\ncontradicting Matthew, Mark, Luke AND John) and spoke to them of things\npertaining to the kingdom of God: \"And when he had spoken these things, while\nthey beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud recieved him out of their sight. \nAnd while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, two men stood\nby them in white apparel: Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye\ngazing into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken from you into heaven,\nshall so comein like manneras ye have seen him go into heaven\" Acts 1:3-11\n\nPaul outdoes every other \"authority\" by saying that Jesus was seen by 500\npersons between the time of the resurection and the\nassension, although he does not say where.\tHe also claims that he himself \"as\none born out of due time\" also saw Jesus. 1 Cor 15:6-8.\n\n>The Ascension\n\nMatthew says nothing about it.\tMark casually says that Jesus was recieved into\nheaven after he was finished talking with the\ndisciples in Jeruselem.  Luke says Jesus led the desciples to Bethany and that\nwhile he blessed them, he was parted from them and carried up into heaven. \nJohn says nothing about it.  Acts\ncontradicts all of the above.  (See previous section)\n\n>When second coming?\n\nMAT 24:34  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all\nthese things be fulfilled.\n\nMAR 13:30  Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall  not pass, till\nall these things be done.\n\nLUK 21:32  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not  pass away, till\nall be fulfilled.\n\n1 thessalonians 4:15-18\n\n>How many apostles were in office between the resurection and ascention \n1 Corinthians 15:5 (12)\nMatthew 27:3-5 (minus one from 12)\nActs 1:9-26 (Mathias not elected until after resurrection)\nMAT 28:16  Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain\nwhere Jesus had appointed them.\n\n> ascend to heaven\n\t\"And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.\" (2 Kings 2:11)\n\n\t\"No man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven, \t...\nthe Son of Man.\" (John 3:13)\n\nAs you can see, there are a number of contradictions in the account of the\ntrial, crucifiction and resurection of Jesus.  If these are good witnesses,\nyou would think that they could get SOME of these important details right! \n(In fact, I cannot find very many points on where they AGREE.  You would think\nthat they could at least agree on some of the points they were supposedly\nobserving!) Because of the fact that there is so much contradiction and error,\nthe story of the resurection as presented cannot be taken as literal truth.\n(Due to the nature of the story, I doubt if it should be taken as ANY sort of\ntruth.)\n\n                   Alan\n\n", "true_class": 0, "title": "ID 610 (FP-FP)"}, {"text": "From: cmtan@iss.nus.sg (Tan Chade Meng - dan)\nSubject: Re: Why?\nOrganization: Institute Of Systems Science, NUS\nX-Newsreader: Tin 1.1 PL4\nLines: 20\n\nboyd@acsu.buffalo.edu (Daniel F Boyd) writes:\n: \n: If the Bible is such incredible proof of Christianity, then why aren't\n: the Muslims or the Hindus convinced?\n: \n: If the Qur'an is such incredible proof of Islam, then why aren't the\n: Hindus or the Christians convinced?\n\nIf God exists, why aren't atheists convinced?\n\n--\n\n------------------+--------------------------------------------------------\n                  |\nTan Chade Meng    |   \"Yes, sir, I have only ONE question:\nSingapore         | \ncmtan@iss.nus.sg  |    What is going on?!\" \n                  |\n------------------+--------------------------------------------------------\n\n", "true_class": 0, "title": "ID 267 (FP-TN)"}, {"text": "From: lamontg@u.washington.edu\nSubject: Re: High Times A Comin'!!!!!!!\nOrganization: 'Operation: Mindcrime'\nLines: 14\nReply-To: lamontg@u.washington.edu\nNNTP-Posting-Host: mead.u.washington.edu\nOriginator: lamontg@mead.u.washington.edu\n\nrubble@leland.Stanford.EDU (Adam Heath Clark) writes:\n>\tIt seems a very large part of Christianity is based on the notion that\n>it is the _right_ religion, and that just about any other way of looking at\n>the universe is flat-out wrong.

But if you can contrive\nto control the action in dreams or do an OOBE, it seems like a morality applies.\n\nNow, there seem to be 3 alternatives:\n\n1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.  In this case no morality\napplies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene', that is, not trying\nto think about anything evil, or indulgining in overly sexy or violent\nthoughts.\n\n2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane')\nEvidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in\ncommon by more than one person.  A\nmark of objective fact is that >1 people report the same objective experience.\nIn this case, the same interpersonal morality/ethics applies in dreams and\nOOBEs as does in waking life.\n\n3) Like (2), but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have a\nreal existence, a different moral/ethics apply there, and no (or maybe \ndifferent) moral laws apply there.\n\nSo... There it is.  Is one of these cases the truth, or does anyone know\nof another alternative?  respond by post or email.\n\nthanks very much\n\n*dt*\n\n========================================================\n\n.\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 217 (FN-TP)"}, {"text": "From: KEVXU@cunyvm.bitnet\nSubject: Re: Christianity and repeated lives\nOrganization: City University of New York\nLines: 36\n\nWhile this is essentially a discussion of reincarnation in the context of\nChristianity Gerry Palo has made some comparisons to Asian religious\nbeliefs on this topic which have simplified the Asian idea of karma\nto the point of misrepresentation.\n\nThere are significant differences in the idea of karma among Hindus,\nJains, Buddhists (and even among the various Buddhist traditions.)\n\nTo refer to karma as a system of reward for past deeds is totally\nincorrect in the Buddhist and Jain traditions.  Karma is considered to\nbe a moral process in which intentions (either good or evil) shape\na person's predilections for future intention and action and\nproduce a person who is more prone to good than evil, or the opposite --\n\"reward\" has nothing to do with it.

I get a little queasy around the phrase \"aren't morally \nresponsible\", perhaps because I've heard it misused so many times.\n(I remember in college some folk trying to argue that a person who\nwas drunk was not morally responsible for his actions.) In general,\nmost folk can't control their dreams, but perhaps what you do all day\nand think about has some impact on them, hm? And I'm not sure what\n\"actions\" are in a dream. But I will note that Jesus does seem adamant\nabout the fact that our thought-life is at least as important as\nour actions. Go lightly with this argument - we are all morally\nresponsible for *who we are* and dreams might well be an important\npart of that.\n\n>Now, there seem to be 3 alternatives:\n>1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.

Anyway, the only \"other plane\" I\nknow of is the spiritual realm. I don't think *anyone's* dreams,\nperhaps outside the occasional prophet's, represent actual actions on an\nalternate plane.

I'll note that the Bible\ndoesn't talk much about dreams outside of the realm of God using them to speak\nto us, with the caveat that such messages are not always very clear, as it\nwarns somewhere in the OT. Given that, I would not give them a lot of\nattention unless you feel your dreams are trying to tell you something.\n\nI would discount talk of \"alternate planes,\" though.

The founder of this\nmovement, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), was proclaimed to \nbe the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in the Scriptures\nof almost all major religions of the world. He claimed to be the \nfulfillment of the long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ\n(metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah.\n\n        The claims of Hazrat Ahmad raised storms of hostility and\nextreme opposition, which are often witnessed in the history of \ndivine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted especial-\nly in some of the Muslim regimes. The right of Ahmadi Muslims to \nopenly practice their religion and to define themselves as Muslims\nhas been severely restricted in many Muslim Countries. The United\nNations, human rights organizations such as Amnesty International\nand top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns \nagainst this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the\nmembers of this movement, but so far to no avail.\n\n        Despite the opposition and persecution, the movement cont-\ninues to grow with a current membership of millions from around the\nworld in over 130 countries, who come from diverse ethnic and cul-\ntural backgrounds.\n\n        The movement is devoted to world peace and strives towards\ndeveloping a better understanding of all religions. Ahmadi Muslims\nhave always been opposed to all forms of violence, bigotry, reli-\ngious intolerance and fundamentalism.\n\n        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-\ntablished a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clinics\nin many third world countries. These institutions are staffed by\nvolunteer professionals and are fully financed by the movement's\ninternal resources. The movement stresses the importance of educa-\ntion and leadership. Its members have included a high number of\nprofessionals as well as world class individuals.\n\n        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral\nreform, establish peace and justice, and to unite mankind under\none universal brotherhood.\n\n\nNEWSGROUP CREATION: \n==================\n\n        The  discussion for this proposed newsgroup has now offi-\ncially ended.

Since Christians citing the Bible in such a context\nshould be presumed to have at least READ the story, it amounts to slander\n-- a charge that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us.\n\n>\"...

And such were \n>some of you...\"  I Cor. 6:9-11.\n\nThe moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_\nin this.  I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of\nactivity that could be named by \"fornication\" or \"theft\" or \"coveting\" or\n\"reviling\" or \"drunkenness\" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may\nor may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very\nfact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at\nall \"clear\" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest\nin MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,\nwith all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated\nChristian discussion of ALL these areas.\n\nHomosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I\nknow) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and\nchild molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly\n\"harmless\" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --\nthat would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter\nyou cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that\nyou want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]\n\n\t\"'I am free to do anything,' you say.  Yes, but not everything\n\tis for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one\n\twill not let anything make free with me.\"  [1 Cor. 6:12]\n\nWhich is a restatement that we must have no other \"god\" before God.  A\ncommandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some\npeople are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.\nIt is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary\nargument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such\nbehavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers.\n\nI won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.\nFundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your\nassumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of\nlaws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of\nwhich Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine\nthem.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are \"moral\" and\nwhich ones are \"ritual.\"  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology\ncourse should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories\nin an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).\nAnd I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus\nfrom the \"ritual law\" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.\n\nI'm dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this\nmatter) about how \"repulsive\" and \"unnatural\" our acts are -- and what\ndo they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of\narbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating\ninsects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you\nsay that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part\nof the ritual law?\n\nFor those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\nbe \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\nit is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\ndetermine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the\nwhole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: \"No doubt I am free to do anything.\"\nBut Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,\nthe Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go\nthrough Leviticus and decide each \"command\" there on that basis, then\nyour own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this\ncontext, it is remarkably offensive to say:\n\n>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the\n>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.\n\nWell, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the\none that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously\n(though one can always find jokers) in \"defense\" of bestiality.  It is\nabsolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\nraise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\nadult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\nthan the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you\nare being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the\nworld.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not\nmine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in\nour culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing\nus as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means\nyou can think of to do so.\n\nJesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,\nthe central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to\nlove one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-\nians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get\nin return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.\n\nChristians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every\ncorner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same\nold verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never\neven read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with\nthe vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\nmanage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great\nemotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even\ntaking the trouble to find out what it is.\n\nSuch behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.\nWHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to\ncondemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN\nto BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?\nGod forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or\ncondemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in\ninsisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are\nSO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.\n\nWhy, for God's sake?\n\n\t\"For God did not send the Son into the world\n\tto condemn the world,\n\tbut that the world might be saved through him.\n\tWhoever believes in him is not condemned,\n\tbut whoever does not believe has already been condemned\n\tfor refusing to believe in the name of God's only Son.\n\tNow the judgment is this:\n\tthe light has come into the world,\n\tbut men have preferred darkness to light\n\tbecause their deeds were evil.\n\tFor everyone who practices wickedness\n\thates the light,\n\tand does not come near the light\n\tfor fear his deeds will be exposed.\n\tBut he who acts in truth\n\tcomes into the light,\n\tso that it may be sh0own\n\tthat his deeds are done in God.\"\tJohn 3:17-21\n\nFor long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from\nevil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and\nrejected.  Some of us despaired and took to courses that probably *do*\nshow a sinful shunning of God's light.  Blessed are those whose spirits\nhave been crushed by the self-righteous; they shall be justified.\n\nHowever, we have seen the Truth, and the Truth is the light of humanity;\nand we now know that it is not WE who fear the light, but our enemies who\nfear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadow\nit with the darkness of false witness against us.\n-- \nMichael L.

STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC\n\n\tYour natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to\npanic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get right\nwith God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your \nonly chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the \nTribulation.  \"But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be \nsaved.\" - Matthew 24:13\n\nII. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION\n\n\tThe Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of\nthe rapture until Christ's second coming.  Also know as \"the time of Jacob's\n(Israel's) trouble\" (Jere 30:7) and \"Daniel's Seventieth Week\" (Dan 9), this \nperiod will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.\n\nIII. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM\n\n\tSoon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community \n(the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will\nbe tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable \npossession during the Tribulation.\n\nIV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tSince all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it\nis imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can\nquote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, \nRevelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to\nunfold before you.  \n\nV. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tPray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray \nand pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual \nstrength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the\nsake of Christ.  \n\nVI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED\nONES DIE AS MARTYRS\n\n\tAfter the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he\nwill institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell,\nor eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be\nuseless.  \"And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and \nslave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that\nno one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, \nor the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding\ncalculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number\nis 666\" - Revelation 13:16-18.  \n\tThe Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of \nhumanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed\nin the past, such as the Holocaust.\n[or maybe the crusades? -M]\nYou cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's\nrule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) \"...I saw\nunder the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and\nfor the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of \nthem: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, \nuntil both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be\nkilled as they were, was completed.\" Revelation 6:9, 11.\n\tHis targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image\nor take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ \"...And I saw the souls of \nthose who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of \nGod, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark\non their foreheads or on the hands.\" - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every\nform of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor\nwill he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, \ntorturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take\nthe mark.  \n\tIf you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,\nyou will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.\n[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]\nYou cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and\ngain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake\nof Fire.  \"...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his \nmark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of\nthe wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His \nindignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the \npresence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.\" -Revelation \n14:9-10 \n\n[and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to\nthe first 5,000 at the stadium --M] \n\nVII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL\n\n\tAlthough you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist's government\nuntil the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is \nimportant for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are\nextremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.\n\tThe first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or\nmountainous area, for the Antichrist's control will come last to the least\npopulated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay \nattuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.\n[\"As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep\ninto our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school\nclosings\" --M] \nStore water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without\nthe mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste\nfrom nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.\n[Get a good water filter. --M]\nBring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,\nbatteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to \nsurvive and live off the land as the pioneers did.\n\nVIII. TRUST NO ONE\n\t\n\tThere will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist's\ngovernment.  Be on the lookout.\n[Perot supporters take note --M]\n\nIX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST\n\n\tIt is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,\nfor he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will\nbring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel \n11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a\nhalf years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be \nphysically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and \npersonality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic\nexpert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which\nhe will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural \npower that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will\nbe deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.\n[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]\n\tThe antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who\nwill make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  \nAll who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and\na half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.\n\nX. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!\n\n\tThe seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of\nChrist.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you \nwill be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  \n\tStart reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of \nyour sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take\nthe mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or\nremain saved, but this time you will have to be \"faithful unto death.\"\n\n\tMay God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!\n\n******************************************************************************\nMike Cluff\t\t\t\t*  \"Christianity is Stupid.\nv22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms\t*   Give up.\" -Negativland\nUB Language Perception Laboratory\t*  \n******************************************************************************\n\n\n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\ \n\nBob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM \n\nThey said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,\nand sank Manhattan out at sea.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n", "true_class": 0, "title": "ID 94 (TN-FP)"}, {"text": "From: mccullou@snake2.cs.wisc.edu (Mark McCullough)\nSubject: Re: Amusing atheists and anarchists\nOrganization: University of Wisconsin, Madison -- Computer Sciences Dept.\nLines: 31\n\nIn article <timmbake.735294667@mcl> timmbake@mcl.ucsb.edu (Bake Timmons) writes:\n>mccullou@whipple.cs.wisc.edu writes:\n>\n>>The line about atheists haveing something up their sleeves is what seemed\n>>to imply that.

A week ago, I managed to find time to consult\na Septuagint Concordance and a LXX text with apparatus at the library,\nand I can now usefully conclude my look at the Greek words for love as\nused in the Christian background of the Septuagintal translation of the\nJewish scriptures.\n\nThe principal result is that there is a cluster of uses of the verbal\nnoun from _erao:_, _eraste:s_ meaning \"lover.\"  This cluster occurs just\nwhere one might most expect it, in the propethic image (and accusation)\nof Israel as faithless spouse to YHWH.

M. Wilson\n   (London, 1923).\n\n2] Another work that might be useful is:\n   \"The Acts of the Apostles, a Critical Edition with Introduction and\n   Notes on Selected Passages\", Albert C. Clark (Oxford, 1933;\n   reprinted 1970).\n\n(This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the\ntext in Codex Bezae is the more authentic.  I don't know if it\nactually contains an english translation or not.)\n\n3] Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is:\n   \"The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in\n   Acts\", Eldon J Epp (Cambridge, 1966).\n\n4] The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the\nearly '80s.  (I can supply the reference if anyone's interested.)\n\n5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.  So if\nyou're interested in examining the differences in the long recension\nan excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in:\n   \"A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT\", Bruce Metzger (United Bible\n   Society, 1971).\n\nMetzger's book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of\nthe Greek NT.  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went\nbehind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in\nthe UBS3.  Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are\nincluded in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts).\n\nIn particular in the introduction to the section on Acts Metzger writes:\n   \"[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full\n   report (with an English translation) of the several additions and\n   other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ...\n   Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the\n   text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the\n   evidence that supports the divergent readings.\" (p 272).\n\n>I understand that one of the early codexes, Vaticanus and Siniaticus has\n>this version of Acts.  It would be interesting to know what the\n>differences are between the long and the short forms.\n\n6] Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have (including the\nones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter\n(or Alexandrian) version.  The longer version to which you refer is\nusually called the \"Western\" version and its main witness is the Codex\nBezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).\n\n7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark's edition\n(mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the\ntext edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains\n18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.\n\n8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations\nin the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The main\ndifference seems to \"expansion\" of detail in the Western text (or, if\nyou prefer \"contractions\" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seems\nto be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specific\ncases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.\n\n9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the\nmore authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anything\napproaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents\npurely the \"authentic\" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be\nexamined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the\nAlexandrian text is the \"better\" more often than not.\n\nN\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 145 (FN-TP)"}, {"text": "From: hudson@athena.cs.uga.edu (Paul Hudson Jr)\nSubject: Re: homosexual issues in Christianity\nOrganization: University of Georgia, Athens\nLines: 38\n\nIn article <May.13.02.31.26.1993.1577@geneva.rutgers.edu> mls@panix.com (Michael Siemon) writes:\n>>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the\n>>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.\n\n> It is\n>absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\n>raise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\n>adult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\n>than the laws of kashrut.

But if you can contrive\nto control the action in dreams or do an OOBE, it seems like a morality applies.\n\nNow, there seem to be 3 alternatives:\n\n1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.  In this case no morality\napplies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene', that is, not trying\nto think about anything evil, or indulgining in overly sexy or violent\nthoughts.\n\n2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane')\nEvidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in\ncommon by more than one person.  A\nmark of objective fact is that >1 people report the same objective experience.\nIn this case, the same interpersonal morality/ethics applies in dreams and\nOOBEs as does in waking life.\n\n3) Like (2), but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have a\nreal existence, a different moral/ethics apply there, and no (or maybe \ndifferent) moral laws apply there.\n\nSo...

He\nwas recently refered to in a TIME article on Babylonian archeology.  \n\nPhony scholarship is when you review their references and find that they have\nmisquoted or misrepresented the conclusions.  Hislop did not.  His conclusions\ndo not tickle the ears, that much is self evident.  But to assert that his\nconclusions are \"spurious\" is without merit.  He gave references to all his\nconclusions and as I have stated, for the last 25 years I have used his\nconclusions in debates at RC seminaries and brotherhoods, not to mention the\nindividual priests and bishops that I have talked to one on one.  No counter to\nHislops scholarship was made.  The only rebuttals were against his conclusions\nbecause they do totally undermined the claims of the RCC. He was showing that\nthe intitution of the RCC was based on the mysteries (which others have shown\neven to this day in various articles and topics).  THe tongues movement in\nCorinth was a direct result of the mysteries entering into the church.  If it\nwas so in Corinth, why could they not have an influence in Rome, the city of\nseven hills?\n\nAlso, you do not have to listen to his conclusions, you can draw your own\nconclusions by looking at the customs, artifacts, the cerimonial dress, the\ndocrine of purgatory, etc from the vantage of the mysteries.

The teacher of the class is what I consider to be\nclosed-minded and bigotted on the subject of what the definition of\nChristianity is.  His definition is tied directly to that of the\nTrinity and the Catholic church's definition of it and belief in\nJesus Christ is not sufficient to call one's self a Christian.\n\nWhile his saying it doesn't make it so,  I nevertheless feel insulted\n(or am I just neurotic? :^) ). I would like to be able to respond to\nhim with some sense of literacy while maintaining an amiable\nstudent-teacher relationship.\n\nSo, is there common definition of what Christianity is?  As the\nprevious discussion of the Trinity did not lend itself to an exchange\nof flames, I am hopeful that this will also not produce major\nflames.\n\nRegards,\n--\nLarry Autry\nSilicon Graphics, St. Louis\nautry@sgi.com \n\n\n\n[Often we get into discussions about who is Christian.  Unfortunately\nthere are a number of possible definitions.  Starting from the \nbroadest, commonly used definitions are:\n\n  a historical definition\n  people who accept Christ as Lord and savior\n  a broad doctrinal definition\n  narrow doctrinal definitions\n\n1) By a historical definition I mean the sort of definition a secular\nhistorian would likely use.  This would include any group that\ndeveloped out of the Christian church, and continues within the same\nbroad culture.  E.g. some Unitarians would fail just about any\ndoctrinal test you could come up with.  Yet it's clear that that group\ndeveloped from Christianity, and people from very different\nbackgrounds (e.g. Hindus) would likely see them as part of\nChristianity.  This is not a definition most Christians like, but it's\nrelevant in some political and ethnic contexts.\n\n2) Accepting Christ as Lord and savior is a test used by many\nChristian groups for membership, e.g. the Southern Baptists and\nPresbyterian Church (USA).  I would qualify it by saying that what\nmost people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to Christ, so that\nsomeone who accepted Christ as one of many gods would not fit.  It's\nan attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not based\non technical doctrine.  By this definition, groups such as Arians\nwould be viewed as heretical Christians, but still Christians.  In the\nmodern context this would include Mormons, JW's, and \"oneness\nPentecostals\".  They would be viewed as heretical Christians, but\nstill Christian.  In practice I believe just about everyone who falls\ninto this category would accept the Apostle's Creed.\n\n3) The next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition,\nwhich includes all of the major strands of Christianity, but excludes\ngroups that are felt to be outside \"historic Christianity.\"  This is\nof course a slippery enterprise, since Catholics could argue that\nProtestants are outside historic Christianity, etc.  But I think the\nmost commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the\nNicene Creed and the Formula of Chalcedon.  The attempt is to\ncharacterize doctrines that all major strands of Christianity agree\nare key.  Obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement.  A\nMormon will regard the LDS church as a major strand, and thus will not\nwant to include anything that contradicts their beliefs.  But I think\nthis definition would have fairly broad acceptance.\n\n4) Finally, some people use definitions that I would say are limited\nto a specific Christian tradition.  E.g. some evangelicals only\nconsider someone Christian if he has had an evangelical-style\nconversion experience, and some I've even heard of groups that limit\nit to their specific church.\n\nI think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used.\nA lot is going to depend upon the purpose you're using it for.  If\nyou're using it descriptively, e.g. in history or anthropology, you'll\nprobably use definition 1 or 2.  If you're using it normatively, i.e.\nto say what you believe the Christian message is, you'll probably use\na definition like 3 or even 4.\n\n--clh]\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 8 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: kempmp@phoenix.oulu.fi (Petri Pihko)\nSubject: Re: Atheism survey\nOrganization: University of Oulu, Finland\nLines: 88\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL9]\n\nI replied to this query via e-mail, but I think there are some\nissues that are worth discussing in public.\n\nMTA (mtabbott@unix.amherst.edu) wrote:\n> I am doing research on atheism, part of which involves field research here\n> on the net.

Thus, some atheism might result from \n>broken-ness.\n\nI'd like to field this one, if I may.  Although I am a believer in and follower\nof Christ, my experiences with religion haven't been all that positive.  In\nfact, there was one point in my life when, for about three days, I simply\n_couldn't_ believe in the existence of God.  Anyway, when I look back upon the\ntroubles I've had, they seem to fall into two categories -- impulses to\nunbelief that resulted from logical contradictions, and impulses to unbelief\nthat resulted from frustration with God.\n\nThe first category doesn't occur to me much anymore, as I have worked through\nmost of the arguments for the non-existence of God.  But way back when, these\nwould cause me some problems, and I would have to struggle with my faith to\ncontinue to believe.  I can see where others less stubborn than I (and I do\nmean stubborn.  Stubborness has often been the only thing standing between\nme an atheism from time to time) would fail.\n\nThe second category arises out of some long-term personal difficulties and\nthe struggle to live my life as God would have me live it WITHOUT living my \nlife as others would tell me how God would have me live it.  A good example of\nthis is my struggle with the more radical Christians I meet.  I am not, nor\nhave I ever been, \"on fire for Chirst,\" and I don't think I ever want to be.\nNevertheless, I am not \"lukewarm\" about my faith, so I don't really\nfit in with the mainstream either.  Quite naturally, I feel a lot of anxiety\nabout my dislocation within Christian society, and it can lead to a lot of\ninternal tension, when I want to do what I _know_ is right,\nbut when another part of me believes that what I want to do is wrong because\nall the other Christians think so to.  Quite naturally, this tension has a\ndestructive effect on my relationship with God, and during all of this internal\nstrife, there's atheism sitting there like the promised land -- no rules, no\nresponsibilities, no need to live up to anyone's expectations but my own.\nComplete freedom.  Of course, it's all an illusion, but nevertheless, it's a\nvery appealing illusion, especially when the so-called \"people of God\" are\nbehaving like total twits.  I can easily understand why someone would go\nthat route, and would be hostile to ever coming back.\n\nIMHO, many of the former-Christians-turned-atheists-who-are-now-actively-\nhostile-to-Christianity are so because their experience with Christ and God\nwasn't a very peaceful one, but one of mind-control and \"shut-up-and-do-what-\nyou're-told-because-we-know-what's-best-for-you-because-it's-God's-will-and-\nyou're-to-young-to-know-what-God's-will-is-yet\" courtesy of some of Christ's\nmore overzealous followers.  \n\nA final reason why people become atheists is because Christians do not have a\nvery good reputation right now.  One of the things that attracted people to\nChristianity in the ancient days was the love that Christians obviously had\nfor one another and the world around them.  Unlike the rest of the world,\nChristian communities actively cared for their poor, and the Christian rich\ndid not trod on the backs of their poorer brothers, but bent down to help\nthem.  Christians were known for living exemplary lives, even if they were\nthought to be traitors to the state because they wouldn't sacrifice to the\nemporer.  Nowadays, courtesy of the media and some Christian leaders who lost\nChrist on their way to power, people see Christians as sexually-repressed\nhippocritical busibodies who want to remake society into a facist version of \ntheir own moral view.\n\nThere are a lot more reasons why people become atheists, but I don't have time\nto go into them right now.\n\n\n\nTom Ault\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 417 (FN-TP)"}, {"text": "From: creps@lateran.ucs.indiana.edu (Stephen A.

Dr. James DeYoung; #3]\n\nR. Scroggs\n\n     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and\nsuggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a\n\"Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic\nterminology.\"  The term is derived from Lev 18\"22 & 20:13 where the LXX\njuxtaposes the two words arsenos (\"male\") and koiten (\"bed\"), and represents\nthe Hebrew miskab zabar (\"lying with a male\").   Yet he believes that Paul did\nnot originate the term, but borrowed it from \"circles of Hellenistic Jews\nacquainted with rabbinic discussions\" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid\n\"contact with the usual Greek terminology\" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs\nobserves, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions\nof pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to\nnative-speaking Greeks (108).\n\n     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the\nobject of the second part, thus differing from Boswell's \"learned discussion\"\n(107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of \"one who lies with a\nmale\" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9),\nwhich Scroggs interprets as \"the effeminate call-boy,\" arsenokoitai is the\nactive partner \"who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress' or who hires him on\noccasion to satisfy his sexual desires\" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not\nrefer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic\nmodel of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he\naffirms (109).\n     This is Scrogg's interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The\ncombination of pornoi (\"fornicators\"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai (\"slave\ndealers\") refers to \"male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave\ndealers [who procure them]\" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of\npederasty \"which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual\npurposes, and the use of these boys by adult males\" (121).  Even \"serious\nminded pagan authors\" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these\ninstances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently\ngeneral condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. \nConsequently Paul \"Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind\" (122).\nWe cannot know what Paul would have said about the \"contemporary model of\nadult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships\" (122).\n\n     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical\nconcerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of\nvices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and\nfunction of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any\nrelationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually\nnonexistent.  He concludes that Paul \"does not care about any specific item in\nthe lists\" (104). \n\n     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary\nphenomenon of a \"catalogue of vices,\"  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are\n\"irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today\" (129).  The \"model\nin today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model\nattacked by the NT\" that \"Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not\nrelevant to today's debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational\ndiscussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify\nrefusal of ordination. . . \" (127).\n\n      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI\n\nD. Wright\n\n     In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have\ncome under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell's\nview is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out\nseveral shortcomings of Boswell's treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults\nBoswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev\n18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the \"Apostolic\nConstitutions,\"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). \nBoswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term\nderives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This\nis significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell's\nclaim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the\ngender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean \"a male who sleeps with\na male,\" making arseno- the object.\n\n     Wright also faults Boswell's claims regarding linguistic features of the\nterm, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that\ncompounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it\nas an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely\none of dialectical diversity: \"No semantic import attaches to the difference\nbetween the two forms\" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which\nthe second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its\nobject and where \"the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its\ngender\" (132). \n\n     It is with Boswell's treatment of the early church fathers that Wright\ntakes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. \nFor example, Aristides' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis,\nandrobaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male\nhomosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell's discussion.  Boswell fails to cite\nHippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the\nSyriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to\nthe Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34). \n\n     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in\nparallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the\ndominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this\nparallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia (\"adultery\"), porneia\n(\"fornication\"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris\n(136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the\nTen Commandments as \"You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis (\"you shall not commit\nadultery\"), ou paidophthoreseis (\"you shall not practice homosexuality with\nboys\"), you shall not steal. . .\" (150 n. 43).\n\n     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein (\"commit homosexuality\") exists in the\nSibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was\ncoined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by\nOr.Sib., book 2 (137-38).\n\n     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew\nupon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John\nthe Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of\nhomosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.\n\n     Wright next replies to Boswell's contention that the term would not be\nabsent \"from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted\n(140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to\nthe first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used\ndozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g.\nDidache) show no acquaintance with Paul's letters or deliberately avoid citing\nScripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). \n\n     Boswell's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright's attention\n(141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom,\nomitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a\nlong uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom\n1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom's infrequent use of the term.  Wright\nobserves that Boswell has \"signally failed to demonstrate any us of\narsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual\nactivity\" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature\nand the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly\nspecified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world. \n\n     Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim\nand I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning\n\"homosexual\" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of\nthe word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell's limited\nconclusion based on them.\n\n     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the\ncatalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed\nin late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of\nhomosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the\npart of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into\nbeing under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke \"generally of\nmale activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual\nengagement with paides\" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were\ninterchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).\n\n     In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning\nhomosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and\nothers who limit the term to \"active male prostitutes\" or pederasty are without\nsignificant support from linguistic and historical studies.  \n\n[Next: the questioning of Wrights position by William Peterson.  After that, we\nget into the \"good\" stuff of historical & linguistic studies.  THis will\ninclude \"Symposium\" by Plato.  If there is any doubt as to the modern\nunderstanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time of\nPaul, this will certainly clear things up.  Also we will review Paul's use of\nLev18-20 in the NT and how, as for him, 1) the Law was fulfilled, but not done\naway with, 2) Lev 18-20 was the universal and the following chapters the\ngeneral.  Those who put forth that the OT no longer holds true today in our\nculture, should stick around for this one.]\n___________________________\n13 R. Scroggs, THe New Testament and Homosexuality (Phil: 1983) 86, 107-8. \nIndependently we came to the same conclusion.  Apparently the connection is\nmade in E.A. Sophocles, Greek Lexicon of the Roman & Byzantine Periods (from\n146BC to AD 1100).\n14   See discussion, 101-4.  He says the same thing about Paul's language in\nRom 1:26-27 (128).  But this is doubtful.  See the more cautious words of P.\nZaas, \"I Cor 6.9ff: Was Homosexuality Condoned in the Corinthian Church? SBLASP\n17 (1979):205-12.  He observes that the words moixai, malakoi, and arsenokoitai\nwere part of Jewish anti-Gentile polemic.  Yet Paul's wors at the end of the\nvice list, \"and such were some of you,\" indicate that \"Paul is addressing real\nor potential abuses of his ethical message, not citing primitive tradition by\nrote\" (210).  Wright disputes Zaas' attempt to associate the term with idolatry\n(147).\n15  On Boswell's treatment of Rom 1:26-7, the article by R.B. Hays, \"Relations\nNatural and Unnatural\"  A Response to John Boswell's Exegesis of Romans 1,\" JRE\n14/1 (Spring 1986): 184-215, is an excellent critique.\n16  D.F. Wright, \"Homosexuals or Prostitutes?  The Meaning of ARSENOKOITAI (I\nCor 6:9, I Tim 1:10), VC 38 (1984):125-53.\n17  In an unpublished paper, Henry Mendell, \"ARSENOKOITAI: Boswell on Paul,\"\neffectively refutres Boswell's claims regarding the philology of arsenokoitai. \nHe finds the meaning to be general, \"a male who has sex with a male\" (4-11).  \n18  Wright's endnotes (148-49) list additional sources in the church fathers.\n19   We also have noticed the same tendency by Boswell to fail to cite all the\nreferences to Sodom and sodomy in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha.  See  J.B.\nDeYoung, \"A Critique of Prohomosexual Interpretations of the OT Apocrypha and\nPseudepigrapha,\" BSac 146/588 (1990):437-53.\n20   In light of the claim made by Boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitai\npoints to a meaning lacking homosexual significance, Wright asks pertinently\n\"why neither Philo nor Josephus use  paidofthoria, nor Josephus paiderastia,\nand why . . Clement did not use the latter and Chrysostom the former?\"  (152 n.\n71)  In a more recent article, \"Homosexuality: The Relevance of the Bible,\" EvQ\n61 (1989):291-300, Wright reiterates these same points.  Paul shows a\n\"remarkable originality\" in extending the OT ethic to the church (300).\n\n \n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 12 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu (David Nye)\nSubject: Re: Faith and Dogma\nOrganization: University of Wisconsin Eau Claire\nLines: 28\n\n[reply to tgk@cs.toronto.edu (Todd Kelley)]\n \n>In light of what happened in Waco, I need to get something of my chest.\n \n>Faith and dogma are dangerous.\n \nAgreed.\n \n>A philosopher cannot be a Christian because a philosopher can change\n>his mind, whereas a Christian cannot, due to the nature of faith and\n>dogma present in any religion.\n \nIt is hard for me to understand, but quite a few professional scientists\nand philosophers are theists.\n \n>Sure, religion has many good qualities.

M. Wilson\n   (London, 1923).\n\n2] Another work that might be useful is:\n   \"The Acts of the Apostles, a Critical Edition with Introduction and\n   Notes on Selected Passages\", Albert C. Clark (Oxford, 1933;\n   reprinted 1970).\n\n(This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the\ntext in Codex Bezae is the more authentic.  I don't know if it\nactually contains an english translation or not.)\n\n3] Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is:\n   \"The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in\n   Acts\", Eldon J Epp (Cambridge, 1966).\n\n4] The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the\nearly '80s.  (I can supply the reference if anyone's interested.)\n\n5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.  So if\nyou're interested in examining the differences in the long recension\nan excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in:\n   \"A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT\", Bruce Metzger (United Bible\n   Society, 1971).\n\nMetzger's book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of\nthe Greek NT.  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went\nbehind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in\nthe UBS3.  Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are\nincluded in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts).\n\nIn particular in the introduction to the section on Acts Metzger writes:\n   \"[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full\n   report (with an English translation) of the several additions and\n   other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ...\n   Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the\n   text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the\n   evidence that supports the divergent readings.\" (p 272).\n\n>I understand that one of the early codexes, Vaticanus and Siniaticus has\n>this version of Acts.  It would be interesting to know what the\n>differences are between the long and the short forms.\n\n6] Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have (including the\nones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter\n(or Alexandrian) version.  The longer version to which you refer is\nusually called the \"Western\" version and its main witness is the Codex\nBezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).\n\n7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark's edition\n(mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the\ntext edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains\n18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.\n\n8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations\nin the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The main\ndifference seems to \"expansion\" of detail in the Western text (or, if\nyou prefer \"contractions\" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seems\nto be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specific\ncases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.\n\n9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the\nmore authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anything\napproaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents\npurely the \"authentic\" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be\nexamined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the\nAlexandrian text is the \"better\" more often than not.\n\nN\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 506 (FN-TP)"}, {"text": "From: mdw@sitar.hr.att.com (Mark Wuest)\nSubject: Re: The doctrine of Original Sin\nOrganization: AT&T\nLines: 53\n\nIn article <May.11.02.38.56.1993.28319@athos.rutgers.edu> Eugene.Bigelow@ebay.sun.com writes:\n\n>>Eugene Bigelow writes:\n\n>>>Doesn't the Bible say that God is a fair god [sic]?

Irrational with respect to their\n>religion only?  What are you saying?  One's belief in a Christian God does\n>not make one totally irrational.  I think I know what you were getting at,\n>but I'd rather hear you expand on the subject.\n\nFaith and dogma are irrational.  The faith and dogma part of any religion\nare responsible for the irrationality of the individuals.  I claim that\nfaith and dogma are the quintessential part of any religion.  If that\nmakes (the much overused in this context) Buddism a philosophy rather\nthan a religion, I can live with that.  Science is not a religion,\nbecause there is no faith nor dogma.\n>\n>>A philosopher cannot be a Christian because a philosopher can change his mind,\n>>whereas a Christian cannot, due to the nature of faith and dogma present\n>>in any religion.\n>\n>Again, this statement is too general.  A Christian is perfectly capable of\n>being a philosopher, and absolutely capable of changing his/her mind.  Faith in\n>God is a belief, and all beliefs may change.  Would you assert that atheists\n>would make poor philosophers because they are predisposed to not believe in a\n>God which, of course, may show unfair bias when studying, say, religion?\n\nHave you noticed that philosophers tend to be atheists?  If a philosopher\nis not an atheist, s/he tends to be called a theologian.\n\nA Christian tends to consider Christianity sacred.  Christianity is\na special set of beliefs, sanctioned by God himself, and therefore,\nto conceive of changing those beliefs is to question the existence\nof That Being Who Makes No Mistakes.  Faith comes into play.  Dogma\ncomes into play.  ``The lord works in mysterious ways'' is an example\nof faith being used to reconcile evidence that the beliefs are flawed.\nSure, interpretations of what ``God said'' are changed to satisfy the\nneeds of society, but when God says something, that's it.  It was said,\nand that's that.  Since God said it, it is unflawed, even if the\ninterpretations are flawed.\n\nScience, (as would be practiced by atheists) in contrast, has a\nBUILT IN defence against faith and dogma.\nA scientist holds sacred the idea that beliefs should change to\nsuit whatever is the best information available at the time, AND,\n*AND*, ****AND***, a scientist understands that any current beliefs\nare deficient in some way.  The goal is to keep improving\nthe beliefs.  The goal is to keep changing the beliefs to reflect\nthe best information currently available.  That's the only rational\nthing to do.  That's good philosophy.\n\nCan you see the difference?  Science views beliefs as being flawed,\nand new information can be obtained to improve them.  (How many\nscientists would claim to have complete and perfect understanding\nof everything?  None---it would put them out of a job!)  Religion\nviews its beliefs as being perfect, and the interpretations of\nthose beliefs must be changed as new information is acquired which\nconflicts with them.\n>\n>Please explain how \"just because\" thinking kills people.  (And please\n>state more in your answer than \"Waco.\")\n\nIt's easier for someone to kill a person when s/he doesn't require\na good rational justification of the killing.  I don't consider\n``he's Jewish'', or ``he was born of Jewish parents'', or\n``this document says he's Jewish'' to be good rational justification.\n\n>By the way, I wasn't aware mass suicide\n>was a problem.

Bailey\n\n     D.S. Bailey was perhaps the trailblazer of new assessments of the meaning\nof arsenokoitai.  He takes the term in I Cor 6:9 as denoting males who actively\nengage in homosexual acts, in contrast to malakoi (\"effeminate\"), those who\nengage passively in such acts.*4   However, he insists that Paul knew nothing\nof \"inversion as an inherited trait, or an inherent condition due to\npsychological or glandular causes, and consequently regards all homosexual\npractice as evidence of perversion\" (38).  Hence Bailey limits the term's\nreference in Paul's works to acts alone and laments modern translations of the\nterm as \"homosexuals.\"  Bailey wants to distinguish between \"the homosexual\n*condition* (which is morally neutral) and homosexual *practices*\" [italics in\nsource].  Paul is precise in his terminology and Moffatt's translation\n\"sodomites\" best represents Paul's meaning in Bailey's judgment (39).  Bailey\nclearly denies that the homosexual condition was known by biblical writers.\n\nJ. Boswell\n\n     The most influential study of arsenokoitai among contemporary authors is\nthat of John Boswell.*5    Whereas the usual translation*6  of this term gives\nit either explicitly or implicitly an active sense, Boswell gives it a passive\nsense.\n\n      In an extended discussion of the term (341-53), he cites \"linguistic\nevidence and common sense\" to support his conclusion that the word means \"male\nsexual agents, i.e. active male prostitutes.\"  His argument is that the arseno-\npart of the word is adjectival, not the object of the koitai which refers to\nbase sexual activity.  Hence the term, according to Boswell, designates a male\nsexual person or male prostitute.  He acknowledges, however, that most\ninterpret the composite term as active, meaning \"those who sleep with, make\ntheir bed with, men.\"  Boswell bases his interpretation on linguistics and the\nhistorical setting.  He argues that in some compounds, such as paidomathes\n(\"child learner\"), the paido- is the subject of manthano, and in others, such\nas paidoporos (\"through which a child passes\"), the paido- is neither subject\nnor object but simply a modifier without verbal significance.  His point is\nthat each compound must be individually analyzed for its meaning.  More\ndirectly, he maintains that compounds with the Attic form arreno- employ it\nobjectively while those with the Hellenistic arseno- use it as an adjective\n(343).  Yet he admits exceptions to this distinction regarding arreno-.\n\n     Boswell next appeals to the Latin of the time, namely drauci or exoleti. \nThese were male prostitutes having men or women as their objects.  The Greek\narsenokoitai is the equivalent of the Latin drauci;  the corresponding passive\nwould be parakoitai (\"one who lies beside\"), Boswell affirms.  He claims that\narsenokoitai was the \"most explicit word available to Paul for a male\nprostitute,\" since by Paul's time the Attic words pornos (\"fornicator\") and\nporneuon (\"one committing fornication\"), found also in the LXX, had been\nadopted \"to refer to men who resorted to female prostitutes or simply committed\nfornication.\"*7\n\n     In the absence of the term from pagan writers such as Herodotus, Plato,\nAristotle, and Plutarch, and from the Jewish writers Philo and Josephus,\nBoswell finds even more convincing evidence for his affirmation that\narsenokoitai \"did not connote 'homosexual' or even 'sodomite' in the time of\nPaul\" (346).*8   He also demonstrates its absence in Pseudo-Lucian, Sextus\nEmpiricus, and Libanius.  He subsequently finds it lacking in \"all discussions\nof homosexual relation\" (346)*9  among Christian sources in Greek, including\nthe Didache, Tatian, Justin Martyr, Eusebius,*10    Clement of Alexandria,\nGregory of Nyssa, and John Chrysostom.  Chrysostom is singled out for his\nomission as \"final proof\" that the word could not mean homosexuality.*11 \n\n     Boswell next appeals to the omission of the texts of I Cor and I Tim from\ndiscussions of homosexuality among Latin church fathers (348).*12   Cited are\nTertullian, Arnobius, Lactantius, and Augustine.  The last named uses\n\"circumlocutions.\"  Other Latin writers include Ausonius, Cyprian, and Minucius\nFelix.  The term is also lacking in state and in church legislation.  By the\nsixth century the term became confused and was applied to a variety of sexual\nactivities from child molesting to anal intercourse between a husband and wife\n(353).\n\n     Having surveyed the sources, Boswell concludes, \n\n   There is no reason to believe that either arsenokoitai or malakoi connoted\n   homosexuality in the time of Paul or for centuries thereafter, and every\nreason\n   to suppose that, whatever they came to mean, they were not determinative of\n   Christian opinion on the morality of homosexual acts (353).\n\nIt is clear throughout that Boswell defines arsenokoitai to refer to male\nprostitutes.  He even goes so far as to conclude that Paul would probably not\ndisapprove of \"gay inclination,\"  \"gay relationships,\"  \"enduring love between\npersons of the same gender,\" or \"same-sex eroticism\"  (112, 166-17).\n\n\n________________________________________________________\n4.

Also, as was observed at\n: the very top of this post, Mary had to be free from sin in order to be the\n: mother of Jesus, who was definitely without sin.\n\nIf the mother of Jesus had to be without sin in order to give\nbirth to God, then why didn't Mary's mother have to be without\nsin in order to give birth to the perfect vessel for Jesus?  For\nthat matter, why didn't Mary's grandmother have to be without sin\neither?  Seems to me that with all the original sin flowing\nthrough each person, the need for the last one (Mary) to have\nnone puts God in a box, where we say that He couldn't have\nincarnated Himself through a normal human being.\n\nMy God is an all powerful God, Who can do whatever suits His\npurpose.  This includes creating a solar system and planet earth\nwith the appearance of great age; providing a path through the\nRed Sea for the children of Israel that does not depend on the\nexistence of a ridge of high ground and a wind blowing at the\nright speed and direction; and the birth of Himself from a normal\nsinful person without being tainted by her original sin.\n\nI see far too much focus on the \"objects\" of religion and not\nnearly enough on the personal relationship that is available to\nall believers with the Author of our existence, without the\nnecessity of having this relationship channeled through conduits\nto God in the form of Mary, Apostles and a Pope.\n\n: Note that the idea of Mary being conceived without Original Sin, i.e. the\n: Immaculate Conception, is distinct from the idea of Mary not having sinned\n: during her lifetime, which is a separate doctrine and, I believe, also\n: held by the Catholic Church.\n\nIf Mary was born without original sin, and didn't sin during her\nlifetime, how is she any different from Jesus?  This means the\nworld has had two perfect humans:  one died to take away the sins\nof the world;  the other gave birth to Him?  I would certainly\nwant to see some scriptural support for this before I would start\npraying to anyone other than God.

Mark and Luke speak of many far\noff, and Mark includes Mary Magdeline and Mary the mother of James the less.\nJohn says that Jesus's mother stood at the cross, along with her sister and\nMary Magdalene.\n\n>Jesus' last words \n\nMatt.27:46,50: \"And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, \nsaying, \"Eli, eli, lama sabachthani?\" that is to say, \"My God, my God, why\nhast thou forsaken me?\"  ...Jesus, when he cried again with a loud voice,\nyielded u the ghost.\"\n\nLuke23:46: \"And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, \"Father, unto\n thy hands I commend my spirit:\" and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.\"\n\nJohn19:30: \"When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, \"It is \nfinished:\" and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.\"\n\n>Events of the crucifiction\n\nMatthew says that the veil of the temple was rent, that there was an\nearthquake, and that it was dark from the sixth to the ninth hour, that graves\nopened and bodies of the saints arose and went into Jeruselem, appearing to\nmany (beating Jesus to the resurection). Mark and Luke speak of darkness and\nthe veil of the temple being rent but mention no earthquake or risen saints. \nJohn is the only one who mentions Jesus's side being peirced.\n\n>Burial of Jesus\n\nMatthew says the Jews asked Pilate for a guard to prevent the body from being\nstolen by the disciples, and for the tomb to be sealed. All of this was\nsupposedly done, but the other gospels do not mention these precautions.\n\n>How long was Jesus in the tomb?\nDepends where you look; Matthew 12:40 gives Jesus prophesying that he will\nspend \"three days and three nights in the heart of the earth\", and Mark 10:34\nhas \"after three days (meta treis emeras) he will rise again\". As far as I can\nsee from a quick look, the prophecies have \"after three days\", but the\npost-resurrection narratives have \"on the third day\".\n\n>Time of the Resurection\n\nMatthew says Sunday at dawn, Mark says the sun was rising, and John says it\nwas dark.\n\n> Who was at the Empty Tomb?  Is it :\n\nMAT 28:1  In the end of the sabbath, as it began to  dawn  toward the first\nday of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.\n\nMAR 16:1  And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the  mother \nof  James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and\nanoint him.\n\nJOH 20:1  The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene  early, when  it \nwas  yet  dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the\nsepulchre.\n\n>Whom did they see at the tomb?\n\nMAT 28:2  And, behold, there was  a  great  earthquake:  for  the angel of the\nLord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door,\nand sat upon it.\nMAT 28:3  His countenance was like  lightning,  and  his  raiment white as\nsnow: MAT 28:4  And for fear of him the keepers did shake,  and  became as\ndead men. MAT 28:5  And the angel answered and said unto  the  women,  Fear\nnot ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.\n\nMAR 16:5  And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a  young  man sitting  on \nthe right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.\n\nLUK 24:4  And it came  to  pass,  as  they  were  much  perplexed thereabout,\nbehold, two men stood by them in shining garments:\n\nJOH 20:12  And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at  the head,  and \nthe  other  at  the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.\n\n>Belief that the disciples stole Jesus's body\n\nMatthew says the guard was paid to tell this story, but no other gospel makes\nthis claim.\n\n>Appearences of the risen Jesus\n\nMatthew says an angel at the tomb told the two Marys and that Jesus also told\nthem, to tell the disciples to meet him in Galilee.  The disciples then went\nto a mountain previously agreed opon, and met Jesus there.  This was his only\nappearance, except to the women at the tomb.  Matthew only devotes five verses\nto the visit with the disciples.\n\nMark says that Jesus walked with two of the disciples in the country, and that\nthey told the rest of the disciples, who refused to believe.  Later he\nappeared to the 11 disciples at mealtime.\n\nLuke says two followers went, the same day that Jesus rose from the dead, to\nEmmaus, a village eight miles from Jeruselem, and there Jesus jioned them but\nwas unrecognised.  While they ate a meal together that evening, they finally\nrecognised Jesus, whereopon he dissapeared.  Returning at once to Jeruselem,\nthey told the\ndisciples of their experience, and suddenly Jesus appeared among them,\nfrightening them, as they thought he was a spirit.  Jesus then ate some fish\nand honey and then preached to them.\n\nJohn says Jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he arrose, in\nJeruselem, where they were hiding.  He breathed the Holy Ghost opon them, but\nThomas was not present and refused to believe. Eight days later Jesus joined\nthe disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced Thomas.\tOnce\nmore Jesus made an\nappearance to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias but again was not\nrecognised.\n After telling them to cast their netson the other side of the boat, Jesus\nbecomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them.  They all eat\ntogether and converse.\n\nThe book of acts further adds to the confusion.  It says that Jesus showed\nhimself to the apostles for a period of 40 days after his resurection (thus\ncontradicting Matthew, Mark, Luke AND John) and spoke to them of things\npertaining to the kingdom of God: \"And when he had spoken these things, while\nthey beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud recieved him out of their sight. \nAnd while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, two men stood\nby them in white apparel: Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye\ngazing into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken from you into heaven,\nshall so comein like manneras ye have seen him go into heaven\" Acts 1:3-11\n\nPaul outdoes every other \"authority\" by saying that Jesus was seen by 500\npersons between the time of the resurection and the\nassension, although he does not say where.\tHe also claims that he himself \"as\none born out of due time\" also saw Jesus. 1 Cor 15:6-8.\n\n>The Ascension\n\nMatthew says nothing about it.\tMark casually says that Jesus was recieved into\nheaven after he was finished talking with the\ndisciples in Jeruselem.  Luke says Jesus led the desciples to Bethany and that\nwhile he blessed them, he was parted from them and carried up into heaven. \nJohn says nothing about it.  Acts\ncontradicts all of the above.  (See previous section)\n\n>When second coming?\n\nMAT 24:34  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all\nthese things be fulfilled.\n\nMAR 13:30  Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall  not pass, till\nall these things be done.\n\nLUK 21:32  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not  pass away, till\nall be fulfilled.\n\n1 thessalonians 4:15-18\n\n>How many apostles were in office between the resurection and ascention \n1 Corinthians 15:5 (12)\nMatthew 27:3-5 (minus one from 12)\nActs 1:9-26 (Mathias not elected until after resurrection)\nMAT 28:16  Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain\nwhere Jesus had appointed them.\n\n> ascend to heaven\n\t\"And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.\" (2 Kings 2:11)\n\n\t\"No man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven, \t...\nthe Son of Man.\" (John 3:13)\n\nAs you can see, there are a number of contradictions in the account of the\ntrial, crucifiction and resurection of Jesus.  If these are good witnesses,\nyou would think that they could get SOME of these important details right! \n(In fact, I cannot find very many points on where they AGREE.  You would think\nthat they could at least agree on some of the points they were supposedly\nobserving!) Because of the fact that there is so much contradiction and error,\nthe story of the resurection as presented cannot be taken as literal truth.\n(Due to the nature of the story, I doubt if it should be taken as ANY sort of\ntruth.)\n\n                   Alan\n\n", "true_class": 0, "title": "ID 610 (FP-FP)"}, {"text": "From: mathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk>\nSubject: Discordian & SubGenius books, addresses etc.\nDistribution: world\nOrganization: Mantis Consultants, Cambridge.

A generation\nbefore the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh,\ngateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather\nthan God's way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which would\nhave given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored their\ndecision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the\nland of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision-\nmakers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and\ndestined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the\ntime they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderers\nhad been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with a\nsigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they\nwere going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence.\nWhatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached\nbones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression of\nhopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nation\nat Kadesh and had God' s promise of one day entering the land. The\nforty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, those\nwho were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the\ninheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Moses\nprays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over.\nAll these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining\npeople through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden.\nHis was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but\nhe also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem was\nthat they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. \"Who is your\nGod?\" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. When\nAaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or young\nbull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bull\nwho had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt's gods as He led\nIsrael to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles grow\nthin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and water\ngushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the\nGod of Almightiness becomes \"ho-hum --What' s next on the miracle menu?\"\nAnd a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He might\nbe all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a right\nto do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these people\nhad known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men's lives had hung\non the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believed\nGod could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIM\nand, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, His\nacts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From the\nday of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God.\nAt Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. He\nhad seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. This\nrequest was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God's glorious\nPerson. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and\nlovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word \"lovingkindness\" is not to be\nunderstood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationship\narising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as the\nlove that says, \"I will never leave you nor forsake you.\" Lovingkindness is as\ntenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its\nheels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based on\nfeelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and,\ntherefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God's love is not an emotion\nthat wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our\nhighest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. God\ndoes not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings\nof love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with\nus! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Him\nto reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- not\nbecause of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committed\nto us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He will\nnot let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us--\nbut a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It is\nsaying to the recipient, \"For as long as we shall live, I am for you.\"  The God\nwho has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--in\nHis coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who is\nlovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will never\nleave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him as\nlove; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeing\nmiracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in the\nheart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power.\nMoses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had for\nthese people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, they\ncould not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born out\nof knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One who\ngives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is to\nmiss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  If\nman is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on\nknowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues from\nlove demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years of\nmeaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to\nknow the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and the\npossibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. The\nlanguage Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its\nmother's love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It is\nwaking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for,\nprotected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we were\nto ask, \"What has the baby done to deserve this?\" or, \"Have arrangements\nbeen made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?\" Our\nquestions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child was\nconceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love's excitement, a love\nthat has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents' love is\nunconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child\nor its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally,\nspontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after\nHis image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the\nLord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to\nearn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identity\nthrough the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents' love. It is a\nscientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if\nit survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has been\nheld and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the\nembrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the new\ngeneration will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in\nthe love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and\ngladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His\nlove. \"Satisfied.\" in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing\nbeing filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describe\nthe earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received\nenough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be\ndrenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is the\nlifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in our\ndeepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems\ndisappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling\nthat he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make\nsense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks this\nsatisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the\nemotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in\nreligious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding\nto the love of the living God. Only in knowing God's love will the rest of life\nmake sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again\nbecame the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find it\nfascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His\nlove. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one would\nthink he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by\nthe knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knew\nbetter. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won't\nfind it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to\nmanipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and\ngive us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyes\nand satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking God\nto make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses' prayer was partially\nanswered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which\nworked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in its\nfullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out the\nlove of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church,\nwe read of the Holy Spirit \"falling upon\" the believers. This is an ancient\nexpression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used in\nLuke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and \"falling on his\nneck and kissing him.\" The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest\nself and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your\nbeing. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes.\nMoses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization\nthat we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taught\nus to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in a\nstate of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance\nand love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive love\nwe cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the Holy\nSpirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness to\nthink on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jaded\nwith the doctrine of \"perform to be accepted.\" We begin to realize that He\nloves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challenge\neveryone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your\neyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may not\nfeel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed the\nother day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians kept\nbehind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rays\nwithout being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing\nthat we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according to\nMoses, \"joy and gladness all our days.\" Joy is the result of a life that is\nfunctioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might say\nthat joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. Man' s highest\nperformance is to rest in the love God has for him... the hum will be joy, and\nthe result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now\nhas in life. Stop wandering in the wilderness. Be satisfied with His love and,\nin joy, day by day, receive all His promised blessings.\n\n\n----- End Included Message -----\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 18 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: acooper@mac.cc.macalstr.edu (Turin Turambar, ME Department of Utter Misery)\nSubject: From soc.religion.christian\nOrganization: Macalester College\nLines: 41\n\n\n\nI found this little gem, I don't know if anyone has any interest/comments...\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHi everyone,\n           I'm a commited Christian that is battling with a problem.

A week ago, I managed to find time to consult\na Septuagint Concordance and a LXX text with apparatus at the library,\nand I can now usefully conclude my look at the Greek words for love as\nused in the Christian background of the Septuagintal translation of the\nJewish scriptures.\n\nThe principal result is that there is a cluster of uses of the verbal\nnoun from _erao:_, _eraste:s_ meaning \"lover.\"  This cluster occurs just\nwhere one might most expect it, in the propethic image (and accusation)\nof Israel as faithless spouse to YHWH.  The verses in question are Hosea\n2:5,7 & 10; Jeremiah 4:30, 22:20 & 22; Lamentations 1:19; and Ezekiel\n16:33, 36 &37 and 23:5, 9 & 22.\n\n\t[ Hosea seems to have originated this usage, which Jeremiah and\n\t  Ezekiel picked up;  Lamentations is dependent on, though not\n\t  likely written by, Jeremiah. ]\n\nThe \"erotic\" meaning (in its allegorical use, not at all literally) is\nevident.  So too in English, unless you complement it with a phrase like\n\"of the arts\" the word \"lover\" is going to have an overtone of sexual\nrelationship.  There is no surprise here, but it is worthwhile to see\nthat standard Greek usage *does* show up in the translations from the\nHebrew! :-)\n\nMore interestingly, and some confirmation of my guess that later Koine\nusage avoided the verb _erao:_ because of its homonymy to _ero:_ (say),\n_eromai_ (ask), there is an error in Codex Vaticanus (normally, a very\nvaluable witness) where a form of _erao:_ is used in a completely absurd\ncontext -- 2 Samuel 20:18, where the  meaning *must* be \"say.\"\n\nIn addition to the above (and the uses I have already mentioned in Proverbs),\nEsther 2:17 uses the verb in its most natural application, \n\n\tkai e:rasthe\" ho basileus Esthe:r  --  and the King loved Esther\n\nand, rather more interestingly, 1 Samuel 19:2 supplies a modest degree of\nsupport to the gay appraisal of the relationship of David and Jonathan:\n\n\tkai Io:nathan huios Saoul e:[i]reito ton Dauid sphodra\n\t-- and Jonathan, Saul's son, loved David intensely\n\n\t[ I'm using the bracketed [i] for io:ta subscript, which I\n\t  don't yet have a reasonable ASCII convention for. ]\n\n(The relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about\nthe \"historical\" facts, but just that a quasi-official translation of\nthe Hebrew text in the Hellenistic period makes no bones about using the\n\"erotic\" verb in this context.  Given the quite general usage of _agapao:_\nfor erotic senses, this need not mean anything \"more\" than _agapao:_ alone\nwould mean, but it DOES disambiguate the relationship, as far as this\ntranslator goes!)\n-- \nMichael L.

And such were \n>some of you...\"  I Cor. 6:9-11.\n\nThe moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_\nin this.  I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of\nactivity that could be named by \"fornication\" or \"theft\" or \"coveting\" or\n\"reviling\" or \"drunkenness\" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may\nor may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very\nfact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at\nall \"clear\" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest\nin MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,\nwith all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated\nChristian discussion of ALL these areas.\n\nHomosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I\nknow) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and\nchild molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly\n\"harmless\" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --\nthat would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter\nyou cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that\nyou want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]\n\n\t\"'I am free to do anything,' you say.  Yes, but not everything\n\tis for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one\n\twill not let anything make free with me.\"  [1 Cor. 6:12]\n\nWhich is a restatement that we must have no other \"god\" before God.  A\ncommandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some\npeople are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.\nIt is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary\nargument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such\nbehavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers.\n\nI won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.\nFundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your\nassumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of\nlaws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of\nwhich Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine\nthem.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are \"moral\" and\nwhich ones are \"ritual.\"  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology\ncourse should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories\nin an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).\nAnd I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus\nfrom the \"ritual law\" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.\n\nI'm dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this\nmatter) about how \"repulsive\" and \"unnatural\" our acts are -- and what\ndo they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of\narbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating\ninsects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you\nsay that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part\nof the ritual law?\n\nFor those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\nbe \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\nit is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\ndetermine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the\nwhole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: \"No doubt I am free to do anything.\"\nBut Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,\nthe Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go\nthrough Leviticus and decide each \"command\" there on that basis, then\nyour own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this\ncontext, it is remarkably offensive to say:\n\n>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the\n>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.\n\nWell, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the\none that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously\n(though one can always find jokers) in \"defense\" of bestiality.  It is\nabsolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\nraise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\nadult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\nthan the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you\nare being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the\nworld.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not\nmine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in\nour culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing\nus as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means\nyou can think of to do so.\n\nJesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,\nthe central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to\nlove one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-\nians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get\nin return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.\n\nChristians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every\ncorner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same\nold verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never\neven read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with\nthe vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\nmanage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great\nemotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even\ntaking the trouble to find out what it is.\n\nSuch behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.\nWHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to\ncondemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN\nto BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?\nGod forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or\ncondemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in\ninsisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are\nSO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.\n\nWhy, for God's sake?\n\n\t\"For God did not send the Son into the world\n\tto condemn the world,\n\tbut that the world might be saved through him.\n\tWhoever believes in him is not condemned,\n\tbut whoever does not believe has already been condemned\n\tfor refusing to believe in the name of God's only Son.\n\tNow the judgment is this:\n\tthe light has come into the world,\n\tbut men have preferred darkness to light\n\tbecause their deeds were evil.\n\tFor everyone who practices wickedness\n\thates the light,\n\tand does not come near the light\n\tfor fear his deeds will be exposed.\n\tBut he who acts in truth\n\tcomes into the light,\n\tso that it may be sh0own\n\tthat his deeds are done in God.\"\tJohn 3:17-21\n\nFor long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from\nevil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and\nrejected.

STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC\n\n\tYour natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to\npanic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get right\nwith God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your \nonly chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the \nTribulation.  \"But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be \nsaved.\" - Matthew 24:13\n\nII. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION\n\n\tThe Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of\nthe rapture until Christ's second coming.  Also know as \"the time of Jacob's\n(Israel's) trouble\" (Jere 30:7) and \"Daniel's Seventieth Week\" (Dan 9), this \nperiod will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.\n\nIII. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM\n\n\tSoon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community \n(the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will\nbe tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable \npossession during the Tribulation.\n\nIV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tSince all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it\nis imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can\nquote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, \nRevelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to\nunfold before you.  \n\nV. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tPray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray \nand pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual \nstrength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the\nsake of Christ.  \n\nVI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED\nONES DIE AS MARTYRS\n\n\tAfter the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he\nwill institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell,\nor eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be\nuseless.  \"And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and \nslave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that\nno one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, \nor the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding\ncalculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number\nis 666\" - Revelation 13:16-18.  \n\tThe Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of \nhumanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed\nin the past, such as the Holocaust.\n[or maybe the crusades? -M]\nYou cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's\nrule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) \"...I saw\nunder the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and\nfor the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of \nthem: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, \nuntil both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be\nkilled as they were, was completed.\" Revelation 6:9, 11.\n\tHis targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image\nor take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ \"...And I saw the souls of \nthose who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of \nGod, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark\non their foreheads or on the hands.\" - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every\nform of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor\nwill he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, \ntorturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take\nthe mark.  \n\tIf you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,\nyou will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.\n[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]\nYou cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and\ngain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake\nof Fire.  \"...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his \nmark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of\nthe wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His \nindignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the \npresence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.\" -Revelation \n14:9-10 \n\n[and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to\nthe first 5,000 at the stadium --M] \n\nVII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL\n\n\tAlthough you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist's government\nuntil the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is \nimportant for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are\nextremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.\n\tThe first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or\nmountainous area, for the Antichrist's control will come last to the least\npopulated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay \nattuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.\n[\"As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep\ninto our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school\nclosings\" --M] \nStore water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without\nthe mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste\nfrom nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.\n[Get a good water filter. --M]\nBring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,\nbatteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to \nsurvive and live off the land as the pioneers did.\n\nVIII. TRUST NO ONE\n\t\n\tThere will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist's\ngovernment.  Be on the lookout.\n[Perot supporters take note --M]\n\nIX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST\n\n\tIt is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,\nfor he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will\nbring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel \n11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a\nhalf years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be \nphysically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and \npersonality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic\nexpert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which\nhe will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural \npower that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will\nbe deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.\n[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]\n\tThe antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who\nwill make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  \nAll who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and\na half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.\n\nX. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!\n\n\tThe seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of\nChrist.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you \nwill be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  \n\tStart reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of \nyour sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take\nthe mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or\nremain saved, but this time you will have to be \"faithful unto death.\"\n\n\tMay God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!\n\n******************************************************************************\nMike Cluff\t\t\t\t*  \"Christianity is Stupid.\nv22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms\t*   Give up.\" -Negativland\nUB Language Perception Laboratory\t*  \n******************************************************************************\n\n\n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\ \n\nBob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM \n\nThey said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,\nand sank Manhattan out at sea.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n", "true_class": 0, "title": "ID 94 (FP-FP)"}, {"text": "From: arromdee@jyusenkyou.cs.jhu.edu (Ken Arromdee)\nSubject: Re: Christian Morality is\nOrganization: Johns Hopkins University CS Dept.\nLines: 24\n\nIn article <4949@eastman.UUCP> dps@nasa.kodak.com writes:\n>|>  Yet I am still not a believer.

I have them, and we all do.  The issue at hand is \nthe sinfulness having sex with members of the same sex, or lusting after.\nSo other forbidden sex acts are a valid topic for conversation. \n\nAnd the idea that these relationships may be  emotional  relationships\nbetween adult humans is red herring.

Hislop's scholarship was\naccepted by the Bristish Oriental Institute which, at the time, was the premere\nInstitute for Oriental studies.  As I've stated over and over,  I've checked\nout about 25% of his references (most are now out of print or in private\nlibraries) and the likes of Wilkerson and Layard hold their own merit.  THey\ntoo came to the same conclusions and if you will trouble yourself, you will\nfind that their knowledge of the mysteries have yet to be surpassed.  Both were\nhighly honored by the British Oriental Museum.  Wilkerson is known as one of\nthe leading archeologist in the history of Egyptiology and Layard is still\nbeing refered two after 200 yrs of archeology in the Mesopotamian regions.  He\nwas recently refered to in a TIME article on Babylonian archeology.  \n\nPhony scholarship is when you review their references and find that they have\nmisquoted or misrepresented the conclusions.  Hislop did not.  His conclusions\ndo not tickle the ears, that much is self evident.  But to assert that his\nconclusions are \"spurious\" is without merit.  He gave references to all his\nconclusions and as I have stated, for the last 25 years I have used his\nconclusions in debates at RC seminaries and brotherhoods, not to mention the\nindividual priests and bishops that I have talked to one on one.  No counter to\nHislops scholarship was made.  The only rebuttals were against his conclusions\nbecause they do totally undermined the claims of the RCC. He was showing that\nthe intitution of the RCC was based on the mysteries (which others have shown\neven to this day in various articles and topics).  THe tongues movement in\nCorinth was a direct result of the mysteries entering into the church.  If it\nwas so in Corinth, why could they not have an influence in Rome, the city of\nseven hills?\n\nAlso, you do not have to listen to his conclusions, you can draw your own\nconclusions by looking at the customs, artifacts, the cerimonial dress, the\ndocrine of purgatory, etc from the vantage of the mysteries.  You don't even\nhave to be a believer to see the parallels.  Just one example.  THe mitre. \nWhere did it come from?  Why is it shaped the way it is?  What are the two\ntails that hang down the back represent?  Was this an ancient  head dress from\nan earlier culture and why was it in Rome at the time of the beginnings of the\nchurch of the State of Rome?  Does it have pagan history behind it, and if so,\nwhy did the RCC chose regardless?\n\nAny lay person of middle eastern religion can answer these questions.  Even the\nscriptures themselves refer to it.  All Hislop did was collect the information\nfrom all the various sources and put them in one binding.  There is no lack of\nscholorship in that.\n\nPlease tell me why you discredit this man by your accusation, yet present no\nevidence supporting it.  \n\n--Rex\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 249 (TP-FN)"}, {"text": "From: revdak@netcom.com (D.

The founder of this\nmovement, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), was proclaimed to \nbe the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in the Scriptures\nof almost all major religions of the world. He claimed to be the \nfulfillment of the long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ\n(metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah.\n\n        The claims of Hazrat Ahmad raised storms of hostility and\nextreme opposition, which are often witnessed in the history of \ndivine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted especial-\nly in some of the Muslim regimes. The right of Ahmadi Muslims to \nopenly practice their religion and to define themselves as Muslims\nhas been severely restricted in many Muslim Countries. The United\nNations, human rights organizations such as Amnesty International\nand top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns \nagainst this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the\nmembers of this movement, but so far to no avail.\n\n        Despite the opposition and persecution, the movement cont-\ninues to grow with a current membership of millions from around the\nworld in over 130 countries, who come from diverse ethnic and cul-\ntural backgrounds.\n\n        The movement is devoted to world peace and strives towards\ndeveloping a better understanding of all religions. Ahmadi Muslims\nhave always been opposed to all forms of violence, bigotry, reli-\ngious intolerance and fundamentalism.\n\n        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-\ntablished a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clinics\nin many third world countries. These institutions are staffed by\nvolunteer professionals and are fully financed by the movement's\ninternal resources. The movement stresses the importance of educa-\ntion and leadership. Its members have included a high number of\nprofessionals as well as world class individuals.\n\n        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral\nreform, establish peace and justice, and to unite mankind under\none universal brotherhood.\n\n\nNEWSGROUP CREATION: \n==================\n\n        The  discussion for this proposed newsgroup has now offi-\ncially ended. Voting will be held for three weeks. If the news-\ngroup gets 2/3rd majority AND 100 more \"YES/Create\" votes than\n\"NO/don't create\" votes; the newsgroup shall be created. \n\n\nABOUT THE VOTE-TAKER: \n====================\n\n        Mr. Anthony Lest has been asked by the proponents of\nthis newsgroup to act as an official impartial vote-taker for the\nproposed newsgroup. He has no objection to  use his workstation\nfor the purpose of vote-taking. Neither the University of Colora-\ndo, nor Anthony Lest has anything to do with the proposal of the\nnewsgroup.

That's quite\ndifferent from Hell Classic (TM). :-) Jesus doesn't sound like the\nusual hell-fire type of preacher.  He attracts people through what he\ndoes. And the stongest example in Jesus preaching is in the parable of \nLazarus and Dives, which is a parable!  In any case, my point is that\na fear-based response to Christ is not a freeing, life-affirming choice\nand isn't Good News in a meaningful sense.  There are plenty of good \nreasons to follow Jesus that have nothing to do with fear or a literal \nhell, that still pertain to overcoming in the present struggle between \nGod and the Disloyal Opposition.

The teacher of the class is what I consider to be\nclosed-minded and bigotted on the subject of what the definition of\nChristianity is.

I would like to be able to respond to\nhim with some sense of literacy while maintaining an amiable\nstudent-teacher relationship.\n\nSo, is there common definition of what Christianity is?  As the\nprevious discussion of the Trinity did not lend itself to an exchange\nof flames, I am hopeful that this will also not produce major\nflames.\n\nRegards,\n--\nLarry Autry\nSilicon Graphics, St. Louis\nautry@sgi.com \n\n\n\n[Often we get into discussions about who is Christian.  Unfortunately\nthere are a number of possible definitions.  Starting from the \nbroadest, commonly used definitions are:\n\n  a historical definition\n  people who accept Christ as Lord and savior\n  a broad doctrinal definition\n  narrow doctrinal definitions\n\n1) By a historical definition I mean the sort of definition a secular\nhistorian would likely use.  This would include any group that\ndeveloped out of the Christian church, and continues within the same\nbroad culture.  E.g. some Unitarians would fail just about any\ndoctrinal test you could come up with.  Yet it's clear that that group\ndeveloped from Christianity, and people from very different\nbackgrounds (e.g. Hindus) would likely see them as part of\nChristianity.  This is not a definition most Christians like, but it's\nrelevant in some political and ethnic contexts.\n\n2) Accepting Christ as Lord and savior is a test used by many\nChristian groups for membership, e.g. the Southern Baptists and\nPresbyterian Church (USA).  I would qualify it by saying that what\nmost people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to Christ, so that\nsomeone who accepted Christ as one of many gods would not fit.  It's\nan attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not based\non technical doctrine.  By this definition, groups such as Arians\nwould be viewed as heretical Christians, but still Christians.  In the\nmodern context this would include Mormons, JW's, and \"oneness\nPentecostals\".  They would be viewed as heretical Christians, but\nstill Christian.  In practice I believe just about everyone who falls\ninto this category would accept the Apostle's Creed.\n\n3) The next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition,\nwhich includes all of the major strands of Christianity, but excludes\ngroups that are felt to be outside \"historic Christianity.\"  This is\nof course a slippery enterprise, since Catholics could argue that\nProtestants are outside historic Christianity, etc.  But I think the\nmost commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the\nNicene Creed and the Formula of Chalcedon.  The attempt is to\ncharacterize doctrines that all major strands of Christianity agree\nare key.  Obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement.  A\nMormon will regard the LDS church as a major strand, and thus will not\nwant to include anything that contradicts their beliefs.  But I think\nthis definition would have fairly broad acceptance.\n\n4) Finally, some people use definitions that I would say are limited\nto a specific Christian tradition.  E.g. some evangelicals only\nconsider someone Christian if he has had an evangelical-style\nconversion experience, and some I've even heard of groups that limit\nit to their specific church.\n\nI think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used.\nA lot is going to depend upon the purpose you're using it for.  If\nyou're using it descriptively, e.g. in history or anthropology, you'll\nprobably use definition 1 or 2.  If you're using it normatively, i.e.\nto say what you believe the Christian message is, you'll probably use\na definition like 3 or even 4.\n\n--clh]\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 8 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: kempmp@phoenix.oulu.fi (Petri Pihko)\nSubject: Re: Christian Morality is\nOrganization: University of Oulu, Finland\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL6]\nLines: 79\n\nDan Schaertel,,, (dps@nasa.kodak.com) wrote:\n\nSince this is alt.atheism, I hope you don't mind if we strongly disagree...\n\n: The fact is God could cause you to believe anything He wants you to. \n: But think about it for a minute.

Does\nshe really want us to _believe_ in herself without any help (revelations,\nguidance, or anything I can feel)? If she has created us, why didn't\nshe make the task any easier? Why are we supposed to love someone who\nrefuses to communicate with us? What is the point of eternal torture\nfor those who can't believe?\n\nI love god just as much as she loves me. If she wants to seduce me,\nshe'll know what to do. \n\n: Simple logic arguments are folly.  If you read the Bible you will see\n: that Jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with \"logic\".\n: Our ability to reason is just a spec of creation.  Yet some think it is\n: the ultimate.  If you rely simply on your reason then you will never\n: know more than you do now. \n\nYour argument is of the type \"you'll know once you try\".\nYet there are many atheists who have sincerely tried, and believed\nfor many years, but were eventually honest enough to admit that \nthey had lived in a virtual reality.\n\nWhat else but reason I can use? I don't have the spiritual means \nChristians often refer to. My conscience disagrees with the Bible.\nI don't even believe I have a soul. I am fully dependent on my\nbody - indeed, I _am_ this body.

Dr. James DeYoung; #3]\n\nR. Scroggs\n\n     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and\nsuggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a\n\"Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic\nterminology.\"  The term is derived from Lev 18\"22 & 20:13 where the LXX\njuxtaposes the two words arsenos (\"male\") and koiten (\"bed\"), and represents\nthe Hebrew miskab zabar (\"lying with a male\").   Yet he believes that Paul did\nnot originate the term, but borrowed it from \"circles of Hellenistic Jews\nacquainted with rabbinic discussions\" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid\n\"contact with the usual Greek terminology\" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs\nobserves, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions\nof pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to\nnative-speaking Greeks (108).\n\n     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the\nobject of the second part, thus differing from Boswell's \"learned discussion\"\n(107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of \"one who lies with a\nmale\" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9),\nwhich Scroggs interprets as \"the effeminate call-boy,\" arsenokoitai is the\nactive partner \"who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress' or who hires him on\noccasion to satisfy his sexual desires\" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not\nrefer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic\nmodel of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he\naffirms (109).\n     This is Scrogg's interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The\ncombination of pornoi (\"fornicators\"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai (\"slave\ndealers\") refers to \"male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave\ndealers [who procure them]\" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of\npederasty \"which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual\npurposes, and the use of these boys by adult males\" (121).  Even \"serious\nminded pagan authors\" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these\ninstances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently\ngeneral condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. \nConsequently Paul \"Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind\" (122).\nWe cannot know what Paul would have said about the \"contemporary model of\nadult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships\" (122).\n\n     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical\nconcerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of\nvices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and\nfunction of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any\nrelationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually\nnonexistent.  He concludes that Paul \"does not care about any specific item in\nthe lists\" (104). \n\n     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary\nphenomenon of a \"catalogue of vices,\"  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are\n\"irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today\" (129).  The \"model\nin today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model\nattacked by the NT\" that \"Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not\nrelevant to today's debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational\ndiscussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify\nrefusal of ordination. . . \" (127).\n\n      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI\n\nD. Wright\n\n     In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have\ncome under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell's\nview is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out\nseveral shortcomings of Boswell's treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults\nBoswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev\n18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the \"Apostolic\nConstitutions,\"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). \nBoswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term\nderives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This\nis significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell's\nclaim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the\ngender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean \"a male who sleeps with\na male,\" making arseno- the object.\n\n     Wright also faults Boswell's claims regarding linguistic features of the\nterm, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that\ncompounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it\nas an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely\none of dialectical diversity: \"No semantic import attaches to the difference\nbetween the two forms\" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which\nthe second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its\nobject and where \"the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its\ngender\" (132). \n\n     It is with Boswell's treatment of the early church fathers that Wright\ntakes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. \nFor example, Aristides' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis,\nandrobaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male\nhomosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell's discussion.  Boswell fails to cite\nHippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the\nSyriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to\nthe Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34). \n\n     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in\nparallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the\ndominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this\nparallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia (\"adultery\"), porneia\n(\"fornication\"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris\n(136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the\nTen Commandments as \"You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis (\"you shall not commit\nadultery\"), ou paidophthoreseis (\"you shall not practice homosexuality with\nboys\"), you shall not steal. . .\" (150 n. 43).\n\n     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein (\"commit homosexuality\") exists in the\nSibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was\ncoined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by\nOr.Sib., book 2 (137-38).\n\n     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew\nupon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John\nthe Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of\nhomosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.\n\n     Wright next replies to Boswell's contention that the term would not be\nabsent \"from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted\n(140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to\nthe first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used\ndozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g.\nDidache) show no acquaintance with Paul's letters or deliberately avoid citing\nScripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). \n\n     Boswell's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright's attention\n(141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom,\nomitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a\nlong uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom\n1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom's infrequent use of the term.  Wright\nobserves that Boswell has \"signally failed to demonstrate any us of\narsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual\nactivity\" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature\nand the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly\nspecified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world. \n\n     Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim\nand I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning\n\"homosexual\" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of\nthe word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell's limited\nconclusion based on them.\n\n     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the\ncatalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed\nin late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of\nhomosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the\npart of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into\nbeing under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke \"generally of\nmale activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual\nengagement with paides\" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were\ninterchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).\n\n     In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning\nhomosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and\nothers who limit the term to \"active male prostitutes\" or pederasty are without\nsignificant support from linguistic and historical studies.  \n\n[Next: the questioning of Wrights position by William Peterson.  After that, we\nget into the \"good\" stuff of historical & linguistic studies.  THis will\ninclude \"Symposium\" by Plato.  If there is any doubt as to the modern\nunderstanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time of\nPaul, this will certainly clear things up.  Also we will review Paul's use of\nLev18-20 in the NT and how, as for him, 1) the Law was fulfilled, but not done\naway with, 2) Lev 18-20 was the universal and the following chapters the\ngeneral.  Those who put forth that the OT no longer holds true today in our\nculture, should stick around for this one.]\n___________________________\n13 R. Scroggs, THe New Testament and Homosexuality (Phil: 1983) 86, 107-8. \nIndependently we came to the same conclusion.  Apparently the connection is\nmade in E.A. Sophocles, Greek Lexicon of the Roman & Byzantine Periods (from\n146BC to AD 1100).\n14   See discussion, 101-4.  He says the same thing about Paul's language in\nRom 1:26-27 (128).  But this is doubtful.  See the more cautious words of P.\nZaas, \"I Cor 6.9ff: Was Homosexuality Condoned in the Corinthian Church? SBLASP\n17 (1979):205-12.  He observes that the words moixai, malakoi, and arsenokoitai\nwere part of Jewish anti-Gentile polemic.  Yet Paul's wors at the end of the\nvice list, \"and such were some of you,\" indicate that \"Paul is addressing real\nor potential abuses of his ethical message, not citing primitive tradition by\nrote\" (210).  Wright disputes Zaas' attempt to associate the term with idolatry\n(147).\n15  On Boswell's treatment of Rom 1:26-7, the article by R.B. Hays, \"Relations\nNatural and Unnatural\"  A Response to John Boswell's Exegesis of Romans 1,\" JRE\n14/1 (Spring 1986): 184-215, is an excellent critique.\n16  D.F. Wright, \"Homosexuals or Prostitutes?  The Meaning of ARSENOKOITAI (I\nCor 6:9, I Tim 1:10), VC 38 (1984):125-53.\n17  In an unpublished paper, Henry Mendell, \"ARSENOKOITAI: Boswell on Paul,\"\neffectively refutres Boswell's claims regarding the philology of arsenokoitai. \nHe finds the meaning to be general, \"a male who has sex with a male\" (4-11).  \n18  Wright's endnotes (148-49) list additional sources in the church fathers.\n19   We also have noticed the same tendency by Boswell to fail to cite all the\nreferences to Sodom and sodomy in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha.  See  J.B.\nDeYoung, \"A Critique of Prohomosexual Interpretations of the OT Apocrypha and\nPseudepigrapha,\" BSac 146/588 (1990):437-53.\n20   In light of the claim made by Boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitai\npoints to a meaning lacking homosexual significance, Wright asks pertinently\n\"why neither Philo nor Josephus use  paidofthoria, nor Josephus paiderastia,\nand why . . Clement did not use the latter and Chrysostom the former?\"  (152 n.\n71)  In a more recent article, \"Homosexuality: The Relevance of the Bible,\" EvQ\n61 (1989):291-300, Wright reiterates these same points.  Paul shows a\n\"remarkable originality\" in extending the OT ethic to the church (300).\n\n \n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 12 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: sjs28257@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Steve Stelter)\nSubject: Re: Mottos to replace \"In doG we trust\"\nOrganization: University of Illinois at Urbana\nLines: 12\n\npepke@dirac.scri.fsu.edu (Eric Pepke) writes:\n\n>\"In Mammon We Trust\"\n>\"Hey, this is just a piece of paper!\"\n>\"Spend Me Quickly\"\n\n\"This is your god\" (from John Carpenter's \"They Live,\" natch)\n\n\n\n                         --Steve \"The Lurking Horror\" Stelter\n                           sjs28257@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\n", "true_class": 0, "title": "ID 134 (FP-FP)"}, {"text": "From: nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu (David Nye)\nSubject: Re: What's a shit shoveler to do?

If you are surveying our individual\nphilosophies, fine, but that's not strictly atheism. Atheism is not\njust another, godless version of the theistic explanations for life,\nthe universe and everything. It is not a belief system, and it could\nhardly be called a philosophical system.\n\nOnce more: Atheism is characterised by lack of belief in deities. \nDo not twist the meaning, or assume that we have some kind of\nphilosophy we all agree on.\n\nSome comments on your questions:\n\n> What contact with other atheists have you had; before and after (and during)\n> your \"conversion\" to atheism?

You also seem to have rather strange ideas of how people become\natheists - those who are alienated from religion do not necessarily\nbecome atheists, they just think very little about religion. It seems\nit requires a considerable time of honest inquiry to find out that\nreligions are actually intellectually dishonest virtual realities.\n\nThose who have never had beliefs will certainly find this question\nquite odd - how can lack of belief be acquired?

A generation\nbefore the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh,\ngateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather\nthan God's way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which would\nhave given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored their\ndecision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the\nland of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision-\nmakers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and\ndestined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the\ntime they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderers\nhad been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with a\nsigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they\nwere going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence.\nWhatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached\nbones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression of\nhopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nation\nat Kadesh and had God' s promise of one day entering the land. The\nforty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, those\nwho were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the\ninheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Moses\nprays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over.\nAll these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining\npeople through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden.\nHis was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but\nhe also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem was\nthat they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. \"Who is your\nGod?\" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. When\nAaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or young\nbull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bull\nwho had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt's gods as He led\nIsrael to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles grow\nthin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and water\ngushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the\nGod of Almightiness becomes \"ho-hum --What' s next on the miracle menu?\"\nAnd a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He might\nbe all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a right\nto do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these people\nhad known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men's lives had hung\non the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believed\nGod could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIM\nand, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, His\nacts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From the\nday of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God.\nAt Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. He\nhad seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. This\nrequest was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God's glorious\nPerson. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and\nlovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word \"lovingkindness\" is not to be\nunderstood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationship\narising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as the\nlove that says, \"I will never leave you nor forsake you.\" Lovingkindness is as\ntenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its\nheels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based on\nfeelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and,\ntherefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God's love is not an emotion\nthat wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our\nhighest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. God\ndoes not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings\nof love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with\nus! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Him\nto reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- not\nbecause of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committed\nto us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He will\nnot let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us--\nbut a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It is\nsaying to the recipient, \"For as long as we shall live, I am for you.\"  The God\nwho has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--in\nHis coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who is\nlovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will never\nleave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him as\nlove; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeing\nmiracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in the\nheart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power.\nMoses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had for\nthese people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, they\ncould not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born out\nof knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One who\ngives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is to\nmiss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  If\nman is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on\nknowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues from\nlove demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years of\nmeaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to\nknow the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and the\npossibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. The\nlanguage Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its\nmother's love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It is\nwaking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for,\nprotected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we were\nto ask, \"What has the baby done to deserve this?\" or, \"Have arrangements\nbeen made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?\" Our\nquestions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child was\nconceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love's excitement, a love\nthat has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents' love is\nunconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child\nor its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally,\nspontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after\nHis image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the\nLord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to\nearn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identity\nthrough the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents' love. It is a\nscientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if\nit survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has been\nheld and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the\nembrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the new\ngeneration will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in\nthe love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and\ngladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His\nlove. \"Satisfied.\" in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing\nbeing filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describe\nthe earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received\nenough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be\ndrenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is the\nlifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in our\ndeepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems\ndisappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling\nthat he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make\nsense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks this\nsatisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the\nemotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in\nreligious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding\nto the love of the living God. Only in knowing God's love will the rest of life\nmake sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again\nbecame the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find it\nfascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His\nlove. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one would\nthink he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by\nthe knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knew\nbetter. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won't\nfind it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to\nmanipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and\ngive us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyes\nand satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking God\nto make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses' prayer was partially\nanswered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which\nworked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in its\nfullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out the\nlove of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church,\nwe read of the Holy Spirit \"falling upon\" the believers. This is an ancient\nexpression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used in\nLuke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and \"falling on his\nneck and kissing him.\" The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest\nself and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your\nbeing. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes.\nMoses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization\nthat we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taught\nus to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in a\nstate of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance\nand love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive love\nwe cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the Holy\nSpirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness to\nthink on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jaded\nwith the doctrine of \"perform to be accepted.\" We begin to realize that He\nloves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challenge\neveryone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your\neyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may not\nfeel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed the\nother day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians kept\nbehind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rays\nwithout being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing\nthat we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according to\nMoses, \"joy and gladness all our days.\" Joy is the result of a life that is\nfunctioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might say\nthat joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. Man' s highest\nperformance is to rest in the love God has for him... the hum will be joy, and\nthe result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now\nhas in life. Stop wandering in the wilderness. Be satisfied with His love and,\nin joy, day by day, receive all His promised blessings.\n\n\n----- End Included Message -----\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 18 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu (David Nye)\nSubject: Re: Faith and Dogma\nOrganization: University of Wisconsin Eau Claire\nLines: 28\n\n[reply to tgk@cs.toronto.edu (Todd Kelley)]\n \n>In light of what happened in Waco, I need to get something of my chest.\n \n>Faith and dogma are dangerous.\n \nAgreed.\n \n>A philosopher cannot be a Christian because a philosopher can change\n>his mind, whereas a Christian cannot, due to the nature of faith and\n>dogma present in any religion.\n \nIt is hard for me to understand, but quite a few professional scientists\nand philosophers are theists.\n \n>Sure, religion has many good qualities.

A day after I finally found out my faith is over,\nI decided to try just one more time. The same cycle of emotional\nresponses fired once again, but this time the delusion lasted only\na couple of hours.

It is _very_ tempting to jump into conclusions, take\na leap of faith, assure oneself, ignore the data which is inconsistent. \nBut it can still be wrong. \n\nI found out that I was, after all, using exactly the same mechanism\nto believe in god - mental self-assurance, suspension of fear, \nfiltering of information. In other words, it was only me, no god\nplaying any part. \n\n> The life , death, and resurection of Christ is documented historical fact.\n\nOh? And I had better believe this? Dan, many UFO stories are much better\ndocumented than the resurrection of Jesus. The resurrection is documented\nquite haphazardly in the Bible - it seems the authors did not pay too\nmuch attention to which wild rumour to leave out. Besides, the ends of\nthe gospels probably contain later additions and insertions; for instance,\nthe end of Mark (16:9-20) is missing from many early texts, says my Bible.\n\nJesus may have lived and died, but he was probably misunderstood.\n\n> As much\n> as anything else you learn.

In general,\nmost folk can't control their dreams, but perhaps what you do all day\nand think about has some impact on them, hm? And I'm not sure what\n\"actions\" are in a dream. But I will note that Jesus does seem adamant\nabout the fact that our thought-life is at least as important as\nour actions. Go lightly with this argument - we are all morally\nresponsible for *who we are* and dreams might well be an important\npart of that.\n\n>Now, there seem to be 3 alternatives:\n>1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.

I've had dreams, some\nfairly vivid ones; is an OOBE just a very vivid dream? I would argue that\nextreme interest in this sort of phenomena is a tad risky; it is probably\nmuch better to think about who Jesus is, and who we are in relation to that,\nthan to cultivate a strong interest in dreams. Unless you feel plagued by\ndreams that are painful and out of control; then pray about it and/or get help.\n\n>2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane')\n>Evidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in\n>common by more than one person.\nWhat on Earth is your definition of \"often\"? I know exactly one case of\ntwo people who had substantially the same dream at the same time, and\nas they were brothers who had spent the day doing the same things I could\nsee why their dreams might be similiar. Anyway, the only \"other plane\" I\nknow of is the spiritual realm. I don't think *anyone's* dreams,\nperhaps outside the occasional prophet's, represent actual actions on an\nalternate plane.

Is one of these cases the truth, or does anyone know\n>of another alternative?  respond by post or email.\nTruth? I don't claim to be an expert in dreams. I'll note that the Bible\ndoesn't talk much about dreams outside of the realm of God using them to speak\nto us, with the caveat that such messages are not always very clear, as it\nwarns somewhere in the OT. Given that, I would not give them a lot of\nattention unless you feel your dreams are trying to tell you something.\n\nI would discount talk of \"alternate planes,\" though.

A week ago, I managed to find time to consult\na Septuagint Concordance and a LXX text with apparatus at the library,\nand I can now usefully conclude my look at the Greek words for love as\nused in the Christian background of the Septuagintal translation of the\nJewish scriptures.\n\nThe principal result is that there is a cluster of uses of the verbal\nnoun from _erao:_, _eraste:s_ meaning \"lover.\"  This cluster occurs just\nwhere one might most expect it, in the propethic image (and accusation)\nof Israel as faithless spouse to YHWH.  The verses in question are Hosea\n2:5,7 & 10; Jeremiah 4:30, 22:20 & 22; Lamentations 1:19; and Ezekiel\n16:33, 36 &37 and 23:5, 9 & 22.\n\n\t[ Hosea seems to have originated this usage, which Jeremiah and\n\t  Ezekiel picked up;  Lamentations is dependent on, though not\n\t  likely written by, Jeremiah. ]\n\nThe \"erotic\" meaning (in its allegorical use, not at all literally) is\nevident.  So too in English, unless you complement it with a phrase like\n\"of the arts\" the word \"lover\" is going to have an overtone of sexual\nrelationship.  There is no surprise here, but it is worthwhile to see\nthat standard Greek usage *does* show up in the translations from the\nHebrew! :-)\n\nMore interestingly, and some confirmation of my guess that later Koine\nusage avoided the verb _erao:_ because of its homonymy to _ero:_ (say),\n_eromai_ (ask), there is an error in Codex Vaticanus (normally, a very\nvaluable witness) where a form of _erao:_ is used in a completely absurd\ncontext -- 2 Samuel 20:18, where the  meaning *must* be \"say.\"\n\nIn addition to the above (and the uses I have already mentioned in Proverbs),\nEsther 2:17 uses the verb in its most natural application, \n\n\tkai e:rasthe\" ho basileus Esthe:r  --  and the King loved Esther\n\nand, rather more interestingly, 1 Samuel 19:2 supplies a modest degree of\nsupport to the gay appraisal of the relationship of David and Jonathan:\n\n\tkai Io:nathan huios Saoul e:[i]reito ton Dauid sphodra\n\t-- and Jonathan, Saul's son, loved David intensely\n\n\t[ I'm using the bracketed [i] for io:ta subscript, which I\n\t  don't yet have a reasonable ASCII convention for. ]\n\n(The relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about\nthe \"historical\" facts, but just that a quasi-official translation of\nthe Hebrew text in the Hellenistic period makes no bones about using the\n\"erotic\" verb in this context.

We may\nor may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very\nfact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at\nall \"clear\" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest\nin MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,\nwith all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated\nChristian discussion of ALL these areas.\n\nHomosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I\nknow) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and\nchild molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly\n\"harmless\" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --\nthat would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter\nyou cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that\nyou want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]\n\n\t\"'I am free to do anything,' you say.

A\ncommandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some\npeople are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.\nIt is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary\nargument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such\nbehavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers.\n\nI won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.\nFundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your\nassumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of\nlaws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of\nwhich Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine\nthem.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are \"moral\" and\nwhich ones are \"ritual.\"  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology\ncourse should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories\nin an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).\nAnd I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus\nfrom the \"ritual law\" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.\n\nI'm dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this\nmatter) about how \"repulsive\" and \"unnatural\" our acts are -- and what\ndo they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of\narbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating\ninsects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you\nsay that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part\nof the ritual law?\n\nFor those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\nbe \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\nit is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\ndetermine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the\nwhole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: \"No doubt I am free to do anything.\"\nBut Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,\nthe Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go\nthrough Leviticus and decide each \"command\" there on that basis, then\nyour own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this\ncontext, it is remarkably offensive to say:\n\n>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the\n>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.\n\nWell, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the\none that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously\n(though one can always find jokers) in \"defense\" of bestiality.  It is\nabsolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\nraise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\nadult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\nthan the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you\nare being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the\nworld.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not\nmine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in\nour culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing\nus as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means\nyou can think of to do so.\n\nJesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,\nthe central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to\nlove one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-\nians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get\nin return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.\n\nChristians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every\ncorner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same\nold verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never\neven read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with\nthe vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\nmanage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great\nemotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even\ntaking the trouble to find out what it is.\n\nSuch behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.\nWHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to\ncondemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN\nto BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?\nGod forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or\ncondemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in\ninsisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are\nSO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.\n\nWhy, for God's sake?\n\n\t\"For God did not send the Son into the world\n\tto condemn the world,\n\tbut that the world might be saved through him.\n\tWhoever believes in him is not condemned,\n\tbut whoever does not believe has already been condemned\n\tfor refusing to believe in the name of God's only Son.\n\tNow the judgment is this:\n\tthe light has come into the world,\n\tbut men have preferred darkness to light\n\tbecause their deeds were evil.\n\tFor everyone who practices wickedness\n\thates the light,\n\tand does not come near the light\n\tfor fear his deeds will be exposed.\n\tBut he who acts in truth\n\tcomes into the light,\n\tso that it may be sh0own\n\tthat his deeds are done in God.\"\tJohn 3:17-21\n\nFor long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from\nevil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and\nrejected.

STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC\n\n\tYour natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to\npanic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get right\nwith God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your \nonly chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the \nTribulation.  \"But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be \nsaved.\" - Matthew 24:13\n\nII. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION\n\n\tThe Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of\nthe rapture until Christ's second coming.  Also know as \"the time of Jacob's\n(Israel's) trouble\" (Jere 30:7) and \"Daniel's Seventieth Week\" (Dan 9), this \nperiod will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.\n\nIII. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM\n\n\tSoon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community \n(the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will\nbe tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable \npossession during the Tribulation.\n\nIV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tSince all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it\nis imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can\nquote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, \nRevelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to\nunfold before you.  \n\nV. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tPray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray \nand pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual \nstrength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the\nsake of Christ.  \n\nVI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED\nONES DIE AS MARTYRS\n\n\tAfter the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he\nwill institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell,\nor eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be\nuseless.  \"And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and \nslave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that\nno one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, \nor the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding\ncalculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number\nis 666\" - Revelation 13:16-18.  \n\tThe Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of \nhumanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed\nin the past, such as the Holocaust.\n[or maybe the crusades? -M]\nYou cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's\nrule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) \"...I saw\nunder the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and\nfor the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of \nthem: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, \nuntil both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be\nkilled as they were, was completed.\" Revelation 6:9, 11.\n\tHis targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image\nor take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ \"...And I saw the souls of \nthose who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of \nGod, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark\non their foreheads or on the hands.\" - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every\nform of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor\nwill he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, \ntorturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take\nthe mark.  \n\tIf you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,\nyou will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.\n[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]\nYou cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and\ngain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake\nof Fire.  \"...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his \nmark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of\nthe wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His \nindignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the \npresence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.\" -Revelation \n14:9-10 \n\n[and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to\nthe first 5,000 at the stadium --M] \n\nVII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL\n\n\tAlthough you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist's government\nuntil the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is \nimportant for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are\nextremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.\n\tThe first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or\nmountainous area, for the Antichrist's control will come last to the least\npopulated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay \nattuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.\n[\"As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep\ninto our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school\nclosings\" --M] \nStore water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without\nthe mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste\nfrom nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.\n[Get a good water filter. --M]\nBring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,\nbatteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to \nsurvive and live off the land as the pioneers did.\n\nVIII. TRUST NO ONE\n\t\n\tThere will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist's\ngovernment.  Be on the lookout.\n[Perot supporters take note --M]\n\nIX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST\n\n\tIt is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,\nfor he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will\nbring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel \n11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a\nhalf years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be \nphysically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and \npersonality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic\nexpert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which\nhe will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural \npower that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will\nbe deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.\n[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]\n\tThe antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who\nwill make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  \nAll who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and\na half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.\n\nX. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!\n\n\tThe seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of\nChrist.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you \nwill be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  \n\tStart reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of \nyour sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take\nthe mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or\nremain saved, but this time you will have to be \"faithful unto death.\"\n\n\tMay God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!\n\n******************************************************************************\nMike Cluff\t\t\t\t*  \"Christianity is Stupid.\nv22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms\t*   Give up.\" -Negativland\nUB Language Perception Laboratory\t*  \n******************************************************************************\n\n\n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\ \n\nBob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM \n\nThey said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,\nand sank Manhattan out at sea.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n", "true_class": 0, "title": "ID 94 (FP-FP)"}, {"text": "From: arromdee@jyusenkyou.cs.jhu.edu (Ken Arromdee)\nSubject: Re: Christian Morality is\nOrganization: Johns Hopkins University CS Dept.\nLines: 24\n\nIn article <4949@eastman.UUCP> dps@nasa.kodak.com writes:\n>|>  Yet I am still not a believer.

I have\nheard theists referred to as \"99% atheists\" because they believe in their\ngod (or gods) to be the _one_ god (or set of gods). The consequence of\nthis is \"what if I pick the wrong god?\" Suddenly, the odds don't look so\ngood because picking the wrong god or wrong doctrines of a god still\nleaves you with the possibility of being wrong and being damned to another\ngod's version of hell.\n\n>>\tDo I sound \"broken\" to you?\n>\n>I don't know.

I had already been an atheist for\nfive years before having any contact with my mother's version of\nChristianity. If anything, I had become somewhat disillusioned with\natheism (uh, oh, I thought, What if there *is* a God?).

Homosexual acts and acts of beastiality are\ntopically aranged together in the law.  This is very important.\nAnyone who would want to say that this command against homosexuality\ndeals with temple prostitution (and I think you would agree that there\nis no proof for this.)

Wilkerson is known as one of\nthe leading archeologist in the history of Egyptiology and Layard is still\nbeing refered two after 200 yrs of archeology in the Mesopotamian regions.  He\nwas recently refered to in a TIME article on Babylonian archeology.  \n\nPhony scholarship is when you review their references and find that they have\nmisquoted or misrepresented the conclusions.  Hislop did not.  His conclusions\ndo not tickle the ears, that much is self evident.  But to assert that his\nconclusions are \"spurious\" is without merit.  He gave references to all his\nconclusions and as I have stated, for the last 25 years I have used his\nconclusions in debates at RC seminaries and brotherhoods, not to mention the\nindividual priests and bishops that I have talked to one on one.  No counter to\nHislops scholarship was made.  The only rebuttals were against his conclusions\nbecause they do totally undermined the claims of the RCC. He was showing that\nthe intitution of the RCC was based on the mysteries (which others have shown\neven to this day in various articles and topics).  THe tongues movement in\nCorinth was a direct result of the mysteries entering into the church.  If it\nwas so in Corinth, why could they not have an influence in Rome, the city of\nseven hills?\n\nAlso, you do not have to listen to his conclusions, you can draw your own\nconclusions by looking at the customs, artifacts, the cerimonial dress, the\ndocrine of purgatory, etc from the vantage of the mysteries.  You don't even\nhave to be a believer to see the parallels.  Just one example.  THe mitre. \nWhere did it come from?  Why is it shaped the way it is?  What are the two\ntails that hang down the back represent?  Was this an ancient  head dress from\nan earlier culture and why was it in Rome at the time of the beginnings of the\nchurch of the State of Rome?  Does it have pagan history behind it, and if so,\nwhy did the RCC chose regardless?\n\nAny lay person of middle eastern religion can answer these questions.  Even the\nscriptures themselves refer to it.  All Hislop did was collect the information\nfrom all the various sources and put them in one binding.  There is no lack of\nscholorship in that.\n\nPlease tell me why you discredit this man by your accusation, yet present no\nevidence supporting it.  \n\n--Rex\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 249 (TP-FN)"}, {"text": "From: revdak@netcom.com (D.

The founder of this\nmovement, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), was proclaimed to \nbe the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in the Scriptures\nof almost all major religions of the world. He claimed to be the \nfulfillment of the long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ\n(metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah.\n\n        The claims of Hazrat Ahmad raised storms of hostility and\nextreme opposition, which are often witnessed in the history of \ndivine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted especial-\nly in some of the Muslim regimes. The right of Ahmadi Muslims to \nopenly practice their religion and to define themselves as Muslims\nhas been severely restricted in many Muslim Countries. The United\nNations, human rights organizations such as Amnesty International\nand top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns \nagainst this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the\nmembers of this movement, but so far to no avail.\n\n        Despite the opposition and persecution, the movement cont-\ninues to grow with a current membership of millions from around the\nworld in over 130 countries, who come from diverse ethnic and cul-\ntural backgrounds.\n\n        The movement is devoted to world peace and strives towards\ndeveloping a better understanding of all religions. Ahmadi Muslims\nhave always been opposed to all forms of violence, bigotry, reli-\ngious intolerance and fundamentalism.\n\n        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-\ntablished a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clinics\nin many third world countries. These institutions are staffed by\nvolunteer professionals and are fully financed by the movement's\ninternal resources. The movement stresses the importance of educa-\ntion and leadership. Its members have included a high number of\nprofessionals as well as world class individuals.\n\n        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral\nreform, establish peace and justice, and to unite mankind under\none universal brotherhood.\n\n\nNEWSGROUP CREATION: \n==================\n\n        The  discussion for this proposed newsgroup has now offi-\ncially ended. Voting will be held for three weeks. If the news-\ngroup gets 2/3rd majority AND 100 more \"YES/Create\" votes than\n\"NO/don't create\" votes; the newsgroup shall be created. \n\n\nABOUT THE VOTE-TAKER: \n====================\n\n        Mr. Anthony Lest has been asked by the proponents of\nthis newsgroup to act as an official impartial vote-taker for the\nproposed newsgroup. He has no objection to  use his workstation\nfor the purpose of vote-taking. Neither the University of Colora-\ndo, nor Anthony Lest has anything to do with the proposal of the\nnewsgroup.  They are just collecting the votes as a neutral third\nparty.\n\nQUESTIONS OR COMMENTS:\n=====================\n\n        Any questions or comments about the proposed newsgroup\nmay be sent to:\n     Nabeel A.

There are plenty of good \nreasons to follow Jesus that have nothing to do with fear or a literal \nhell, that still pertain to overcoming in the present struggle between \nGod and the Disloyal Opposition.

The teacher of the class is what I consider to be\nclosed-minded and bigotted on the subject of what the definition of\nChristianity is.

I would like to be able to respond to\nhim with some sense of literacy while maintaining an amiable\nstudent-teacher relationship.\n\nSo, is there common definition of what Christianity is?  As the\nprevious discussion of the Trinity did not lend itself to an exchange\nof flames, I am hopeful that this will also not produce major\nflames.\n\nRegards,\n--\nLarry Autry\nSilicon Graphics, St. Louis\nautry@sgi.com \n\n\n\n[Often we get into discussions about who is Christian.  Unfortunately\nthere are a number of possible definitions.  Starting from the \nbroadest, commonly used definitions are:\n\n  a historical definition\n  people who accept Christ as Lord and savior\n  a broad doctrinal definition\n  narrow doctrinal definitions\n\n1) By a historical definition I mean the sort of definition a secular\nhistorian would likely use.  This would include any group that\ndeveloped out of the Christian church, and continues within the same\nbroad culture.  E.g. some Unitarians would fail just about any\ndoctrinal test you could come up with.  Yet it's clear that that group\ndeveloped from Christianity, and people from very different\nbackgrounds (e.g. Hindus) would likely see them as part of\nChristianity.  This is not a definition most Christians like, but it's\nrelevant in some political and ethnic contexts.\n\n2) Accepting Christ as Lord and savior is a test used by many\nChristian groups for membership, e.g. the Southern Baptists and\nPresbyterian Church (USA).  I would qualify it by saying that what\nmost people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to Christ, so that\nsomeone who accepted Christ as one of many gods would not fit.  It's\nan attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not based\non technical doctrine.  By this definition, groups such as Arians\nwould be viewed as heretical Christians, but still Christians.  In the\nmodern context this would include Mormons, JW's, and \"oneness\nPentecostals\".  They would be viewed as heretical Christians, but\nstill Christian.  In practice I believe just about everyone who falls\ninto this category would accept the Apostle's Creed.\n\n3) The next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition,\nwhich includes all of the major strands of Christianity, but excludes\ngroups that are felt to be outside \"historic Christianity.\"  This is\nof course a slippery enterprise, since Catholics could argue that\nProtestants are outside historic Christianity, etc.  But I think the\nmost commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the\nNicene Creed and the Formula of Chalcedon.  The attempt is to\ncharacterize doctrines that all major strands of Christianity agree\nare key.  Obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement.  A\nMormon will regard the LDS church as a major strand, and thus will not\nwant to include anything that contradicts their beliefs.  But I think\nthis definition would have fairly broad acceptance.\n\n4) Finally, some people use definitions that I would say are limited\nto a specific Christian tradition.  E.g. some evangelicals only\nconsider someone Christian if he has had an evangelical-style\nconversion experience, and some I've even heard of groups that limit\nit to their specific church.\n\nI think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used.\nA lot is going to depend upon the purpose you're using it for.  If\nyou're using it descriptively, e.g. in history or anthropology, you'll\nprobably use definition 1 or 2.  If you're using it normatively, i.e.\nto say what you believe the Christian message is, you'll probably use\na definition like 3 or even 4.\n\n--clh]\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 8 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: kempmp@phoenix.oulu.fi (Petri Pihko)\nSubject: Re: Christian Morality is\nOrganization: University of Oulu, Finland\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL6]\nLines: 79\n\nDan Schaertel,,, (dps@nasa.kodak.com) wrote:\n\nSince this is alt.atheism, I hope you don't mind if we strongly disagree...\n\n: The fact is God could cause you to believe anything He wants you to. \n: But think about it for a minute.

Dr. James DeYoung; #3]\n\nR. Scroggs\n\n     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and\nsuggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a\n\"Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic\nterminology.\"  The term is derived from Lev 18\"22 & 20:13 where the LXX\njuxtaposes the two words arsenos (\"male\") and koiten (\"bed\"), and represents\nthe Hebrew miskab zabar (\"lying with a male\").   Yet he believes that Paul did\nnot originate the term, but borrowed it from \"circles of Hellenistic Jews\nacquainted with rabbinic discussions\" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid\n\"contact with the usual Greek terminology\" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs\nobserves, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions\nof pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to\nnative-speaking Greeks (108).\n\n     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the\nobject of the second part, thus differing from Boswell's \"learned discussion\"\n(107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of \"one who lies with a\nmale\" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9),\nwhich Scroggs interprets as \"the effeminate call-boy,\" arsenokoitai is the\nactive partner \"who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress' or who hires him on\noccasion to satisfy his sexual desires\" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not\nrefer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic\nmodel of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he\naffirms (109).\n     This is Scrogg's interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The\ncombination of pornoi (\"fornicators\"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai (\"slave\ndealers\") refers to \"male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave\ndealers [who procure them]\" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of\npederasty \"which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual\npurposes, and the use of these boys by adult males\" (121).  Even \"serious\nminded pagan authors\" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these\ninstances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently\ngeneral condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. \nConsequently Paul \"Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind\" (122).\nWe cannot know what Paul would have said about the \"contemporary model of\nadult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships\" (122).\n\n     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical\nconcerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of\nvices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and\nfunction of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any\nrelationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually\nnonexistent.  He concludes that Paul \"does not care about any specific item in\nthe lists\" (104). \n\n     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary\nphenomenon of a \"catalogue of vices,\"  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are\n\"irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today\" (129).  The \"model\nin today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model\nattacked by the NT\" that \"Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not\nrelevant to today's debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational\ndiscussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify\nrefusal of ordination. . . \" (127).\n\n      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI\n\nD. Wright\n\n     In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have\ncome under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell's\nview is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out\nseveral shortcomings of Boswell's treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults\nBoswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev\n18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the \"Apostolic\nConstitutions,\"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). \nBoswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term\nderives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This\nis significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell's\nclaim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the\ngender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean \"a male who sleeps with\na male,\" making arseno- the object.\n\n     Wright also faults Boswell's claims regarding linguistic features of the\nterm, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that\ncompounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it\nas an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely\none of dialectical diversity: \"No semantic import attaches to the difference\nbetween the two forms\" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which\nthe second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its\nobject and where \"the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its\ngender\" (132). \n\n     It is with Boswell's treatment of the early church fathers that Wright\ntakes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. \nFor example, Aristides' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis,\nandrobaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male\nhomosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell's discussion.  Boswell fails to cite\nHippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the\nSyriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to\nthe Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34). \n\n     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in\nparallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the\ndominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this\nparallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia (\"adultery\"), porneia\n(\"fornication\"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris\n(136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the\nTen Commandments as \"You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis (\"you shall not commit\nadultery\"), ou paidophthoreseis (\"you shall not practice homosexuality with\nboys\"), you shall not steal. . .\" (150 n. 43).\n\n     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein (\"commit homosexuality\") exists in the\nSibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was\ncoined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by\nOr.Sib., book 2 (137-38).\n\n     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew\nupon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John\nthe Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of\nhomosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.\n\n     Wright next replies to Boswell's contention that the term would not be\nabsent \"from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted\n(140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to\nthe first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used\ndozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g.\nDidache) show no acquaintance with Paul's letters or deliberately avoid citing\nScripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). \n\n     Boswell's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright's attention\n(141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom,\nomitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a\nlong uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom\n1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom's infrequent use of the term.  Wright\nobserves that Boswell has \"signally failed to demonstrate any us of\narsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual\nactivity\" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature\nand the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly\nspecified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world. \n\n     Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim\nand I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning\n\"homosexual\" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of\nthe word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell's limited\nconclusion based on them.\n\n     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the\ncatalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed\nin late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of\nhomosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the\npart of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into\nbeing under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke \"generally of\nmale activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual\nengagement with paides\" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were\ninterchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).\n\n     In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning\nhomosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and\nothers who limit the term to \"active male prostitutes\" or pederasty are without\nsignificant support from linguistic and historical studies.  \n\n[Next: the questioning of Wrights position by William Peterson.  After that, we\nget into the \"good\" stuff of historical & linguistic studies.  THis will\ninclude \"Symposium\" by Plato.  If there is any doubt as to the modern\nunderstanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time of\nPaul, this will certainly clear things up.  Also we will review Paul's use of\nLev18-20 in the NT and how, as for him, 1) the Law was fulfilled, but not done\naway with, 2) Lev 18-20 was the universal and the following chapters the\ngeneral.  Those who put forth that the OT no longer holds true today in our\nculture, should stick around for this one.]\n___________________________\n13 R. Scroggs, THe New Testament and Homosexuality (Phil: 1983) 86, 107-8. \nIndependently we came to the same conclusion.  Apparently the connection is\nmade in E.A. Sophocles, Greek Lexicon of the Roman & Byzantine Periods (from\n146BC to AD 1100).\n14   See discussion, 101-4.  He says the same thing about Paul's language in\nRom 1:26-27 (128).  But this is doubtful.  See the more cautious words of P.\nZaas, \"I Cor 6.9ff: Was Homosexuality Condoned in the Corinthian Church? SBLASP\n17 (1979):205-12.  He observes that the words moixai, malakoi, and arsenokoitai\nwere part of Jewish anti-Gentile polemic.  Yet Paul's wors at the end of the\nvice list, \"and such were some of you,\" indicate that \"Paul is addressing real\nor potential abuses of his ethical message, not citing primitive tradition by\nrote\" (210).  Wright disputes Zaas' attempt to associate the term with idolatry\n(147).\n15  On Boswell's treatment of Rom 1:26-7, the article by R.B. Hays, \"Relations\nNatural and Unnatural\"  A Response to John Boswell's Exegesis of Romans 1,\" JRE\n14/1 (Spring 1986): 184-215, is an excellent critique.\n16  D.F. Wright, \"Homosexuals or Prostitutes?  The Meaning of ARSENOKOITAI (I\nCor 6:9, I Tim 1:10), VC 38 (1984):125-53.\n17  In an unpublished paper, Henry Mendell, \"ARSENOKOITAI: Boswell on Paul,\"\neffectively refutres Boswell's claims regarding the philology of arsenokoitai. \nHe finds the meaning to be general, \"a male who has sex with a male\" (4-11).  \n18  Wright's endnotes (148-49) list additional sources in the church fathers.\n19   We also have noticed the same tendency by Boswell to fail to cite all the\nreferences to Sodom and sodomy in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha.  See  J.B.\nDeYoung, \"A Critique of Prohomosexual Interpretations of the OT Apocrypha and\nPseudepigrapha,\" BSac 146/588 (1990):437-53.\n20   In light of the claim made by Boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitai\npoints to a meaning lacking homosexual significance, Wright asks pertinently\n\"why neither Philo nor Josephus use  paidofthoria, nor Josephus paiderastia,\nand why . . Clement did not use the latter and Chrysostom the former?\"  (152 n.\n71)  In a more recent article, \"Homosexuality: The Relevance of the Bible,\" EvQ\n61 (1989):291-300, Wright reiterates these same points.  Paul shows a\n\"remarkable originality\" in extending the OT ethic to the church (300).\n\n \n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 12 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: sjs28257@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Steve Stelter)\nSubject: Re: Mottos to replace \"In doG we trust\"\nOrganization: University of Illinois at Urbana\nLines: 12\n\npepke@dirac.scri.fsu.edu (Eric Pepke) writes:\n\n>\"In Mammon We Trust\"\n>\"Hey, this is just a piece of paper!\"\n>\"Spend Me Quickly\"\n\n\"This is your god\" (from John Carpenter's \"They Live,\" natch)\n\n\n\n                         --Steve \"The Lurking Horror\" Stelter\n                           sjs28257@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\n", "true_class": 0, "title": "ID 134 (FP-FP)"}, {"text": "From: nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu (David Nye)\nSubject: Re: What's a shit shoveler to do?

A generation\nbefore the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh,\ngateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather\nthan God's way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which would\nhave given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored their\ndecision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the\nland of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision-\nmakers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and\ndestined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the\ntime they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderers\nhad been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with a\nsigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they\nwere going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence.\nWhatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached\nbones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression of\nhopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nation\nat Kadesh and had God' s promise of one day entering the land. The\nforty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, those\nwho were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the\ninheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Moses\nprays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over.\nAll these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining\npeople through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden.\nHis was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but\nhe also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem was\nthat they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. \"Who is your\nGod?\" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. When\nAaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or young\nbull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bull\nwho had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt's gods as He led\nIsrael to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles grow\nthin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and water\ngushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the\nGod of Almightiness becomes \"ho-hum --What' s next on the miracle menu?\"\nAnd a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He might\nbe all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a right\nto do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these people\nhad known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men's lives had hung\non the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believed\nGod could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIM\nand, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, His\nacts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From the\nday of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God.\nAt Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. He\nhad seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. This\nrequest was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God's glorious\nPerson. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and\nlovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word \"lovingkindness\" is not to be\nunderstood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationship\narising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as the\nlove that says, \"I will never leave you nor forsake you.\" Lovingkindness is as\ntenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its\nheels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based on\nfeelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and,\ntherefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God's love is not an emotion\nthat wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our\nhighest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. God\ndoes not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings\nof love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with\nus! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Him\nto reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- not\nbecause of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committed\nto us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He will\nnot let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us--\nbut a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It is\nsaying to the recipient, \"For as long as we shall live, I am for you.\"  The God\nwho has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--in\nHis coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who is\nlovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will never\nleave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him as\nlove; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeing\nmiracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in the\nheart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power.\nMoses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had for\nthese people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, they\ncould not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born out\nof knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One who\ngives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is to\nmiss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  If\nman is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on\nknowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues from\nlove demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years of\nmeaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to\nknow the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and the\npossibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. The\nlanguage Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its\nmother's love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It is\nwaking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for,\nprotected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we were\nto ask, \"What has the baby done to deserve this?\" or, \"Have arrangements\nbeen made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?\" Our\nquestions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child was\nconceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love's excitement, a love\nthat has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents' love is\nunconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child\nor its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally,\nspontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after\nHis image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the\nLord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to\nearn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identity\nthrough the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents' love. It is a\nscientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if\nit survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has been\nheld and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the\nembrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the new\ngeneration will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in\nthe love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and\ngladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His\nlove. \"Satisfied.\" in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing\nbeing filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describe\nthe earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received\nenough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be\ndrenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is the\nlifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in our\ndeepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems\ndisappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling\nthat he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make\nsense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks this\nsatisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the\nemotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in\nreligious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding\nto the love of the living God. Only in knowing God's love will the rest of life\nmake sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again\nbecame the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find it\nfascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His\nlove. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one would\nthink he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by\nthe knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knew\nbetter. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won't\nfind it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to\nmanipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and\ngive us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyes\nand satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking God\nto make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses' prayer was partially\nanswered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which\nworked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in its\nfullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out the\nlove of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church,\nwe read of the Holy Spirit \"falling upon\" the believers. This is an ancient\nexpression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used in\nLuke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and \"falling on his\nneck and kissing him.\" The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest\nself and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your\nbeing. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes.\nMoses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization\nthat we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taught\nus to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in a\nstate of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance\nand love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive love\nwe cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the Holy\nSpirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness to\nthink on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jaded\nwith the doctrine of \"perform to be accepted.\" We begin to realize that He\nloves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challenge\neveryone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your\neyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may not\nfeel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed the\nother day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians kept\nbehind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rays\nwithout being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing\nthat we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according to\nMoses, \"joy and gladness all our days.\" Joy is the result of a life that is\nfunctioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might say\nthat joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. Man' s highest\nperformance is to rest in the love God has for him... the hum will be joy, and\nthe result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now\nhas in life. Stop wandering in the wilderness. Be satisfied with His love and,\nin joy, day by day, receive all His promised blessings.\n\n\n----- End Included Message -----\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 18 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu (David Nye)\nSubject: Re: Faith and Dogma\nOrganization: University of Wisconsin Eau Claire\nLines: 28\n\n[reply to tgk@cs.toronto.edu (Todd Kelley)]\n \n>In light of what happened in Waco, I need to get something of my chest.\n \n>Faith and dogma are dangerous.\n \nAgreed.\n \n>A philosopher cannot be a Christian because a philosopher can change\n>his mind, whereas a Christian cannot, due to the nature of faith and\n>dogma present in any religion.\n \nIt is hard for me to understand, but quite a few professional scientists\nand philosophers are theists.\n \n>Sure, religion has many good qualities.

I _hated_ experiments\nlike this - they are old-fashioned and increase the student's workload\nconsiderably. Besides, I had to do it twice, since I failed in my first\nattempt. However, I think I'll never forget the lesson: \n\nNo matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is X,\nit may still be Y. It is _very_ tempting to jump into conclusions, take\na leap of faith, assure oneself, ignore the data which is inconsistent. \nBut it can still be wrong. \n\nI found out that I was, after all, using exactly the same mechanism\nto believe in god - mental self-assurance, suspension of fear, \nfiltering of information. In other words, it was only me, no god\nplaying any part. \n\n> The life , death, and resurection of Christ is documented historical fact.\n\nOh? And I had better believe this? Dan, many UFO stories are much better\ndocumented than the resurrection of Jesus. The resurrection is documented\nquite haphazardly in the Bible - it seems the authors did not pay too\nmuch attention to which wild rumour to leave out. Besides, the ends of\nthe gospels probably contain later additions and insertions; for instance,\nthe end of Mark (16:9-20) is missing from many early texts, says my Bible.\n\nJesus may have lived and died, but he was probably misunderstood.\n\n> As much\n> as anything else you learn.  How do you choose what to believe and \n> what not to?\n\nThis is easy. I believe that the world exists independent of my mind,\nand that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what I\nobserve. Nothing else need to be taken on faith, I will go by the\nevidence. \n\nIt makes no difference whether I believe George Washington existed or not.\nI assume that he did, considering the vast amount of evidence presented.\n\n> There is no way to get into a sceptical heart.

Those who do are usually remembered\nas heroes, at least among those who believe. Dan, do you think I'm\nlying when I say I believed firmly for 15 years? It seems it is \nvery difficult to admit that someone who has really believed does not\ndo so anymore. But I can't go on lying to myself.\n\nBlind trust is dangerous, and I was just another blind led by the blind.\nBut if god really wants me, she'll know what to do. I'm willing. I just\ndon't know whether she exists - looking at the available evidence,\nit looks like she doesn't. \n\nPetri\n--\n ___. .'*''.*        Petri Pihko    kem-pmp@          Mathematics is the Truth.\n!___.'* '.'*' ' .

I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of\nactivity that could be named by \"fornication\" or \"theft\" or \"coveting\" or\n\"reviling\" or \"drunkenness\" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may\nor may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very\nfact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at\nall \"clear\" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest\nin MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,\nwith all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated\nChristian discussion of ALL these areas.\n\nHomosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I\nknow) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and\nchild molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly\n\"harmless\" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --\nthat would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter\nyou cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that\nyou want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]\n\n\t\"'I am free to do anything,' you say.  Yes, but not everything\n\tis for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one\n\twill not let anything make free with me.\"  [1 Cor. 6:12]\n\nWhich is a restatement that we must have no other \"god\" before God.  A\ncommandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some\npeople are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.\nIt is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary\nargument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such\nbehavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers.\n\nI won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.\nFundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your\nassumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of\nlaws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of\nwhich Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine\nthem.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are \"moral\" and\nwhich ones are \"ritual.\"  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology\ncourse should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories\nin an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).\nAnd I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus\nfrom the \"ritual law\" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.\n\nI'm dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this\nmatter) about how \"repulsive\" and \"unnatural\" our acts are -- and what\ndo they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of\narbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating\ninsects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you\nsay that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part\nof the ritual law?\n\nFor those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\nbe \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\nit is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\ndetermine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the\nwhole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: \"No doubt I am free to do anything.\"\nBut Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,\nthe Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go\nthrough Leviticus and decide each \"command\" there on that basis, then\nyour own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this\ncontext, it is remarkably offensive to say:\n\n>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the\n>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.\n\nWell, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the\none that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously\n(though one can always find jokers) in \"defense\" of bestiality.  It is\nabsolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\nraise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\nadult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\nthan the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you\nare being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the\nworld.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not\nmine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in\nour culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing\nus as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means\nyou can think of to do so.\n\nJesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,\nthe central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to\nlove one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-\nians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get\nin return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.\n\nChristians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every\ncorner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same\nold verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never\neven read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with\nthe vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\nmanage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great\nemotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even\ntaking the trouble to find out what it is.\n\nSuch behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.\nWHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to\ncondemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN\nto BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?\nGod forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or\ncondemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in\ninsisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are\nSO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.\n\nWhy, for God's sake?\n\n\t\"For God did not send the Son into the world\n\tto condemn the world,\n\tbut that the world might be saved through him.\n\tWhoever believes in him is not condemned,\n\tbut whoever does not believe has already been condemned\n\tfor refusing to believe in the name of God's only Son.\n\tNow the judgment is this:\n\tthe light has come into the world,\n\tbut men have preferred darkness to light\n\tbecause their deeds were evil.\n\tFor everyone who practices wickedness\n\thates the light,\n\tand does not come near the light\n\tfor fear his deeds will be exposed.\n\tBut he who acts in truth\n\tcomes into the light,\n\tso that it may be sh0own\n\tthat his deeds are done in God.\"\tJohn 3:17-21\n\nFor long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from\nevil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and\nrejected.

STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC\n\n\tYour natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to\npanic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get right\nwith God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your \nonly chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the \nTribulation.  \"But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be \nsaved.\" - Matthew 24:13\n\nII. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION\n\n\tThe Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of\nthe rapture until Christ's second coming.  Also know as \"the time of Jacob's\n(Israel's) trouble\" (Jere 30:7) and \"Daniel's Seventieth Week\" (Dan 9), this \nperiod will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.\n\nIII. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM\n\n\tSoon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community \n(the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will\nbe tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable \npossession during the Tribulation.\n\nIV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tSince all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it\nis imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can\nquote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, \nRevelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to\nunfold before you.  \n\nV. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tPray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray \nand pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual \nstrength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the\nsake of Christ.  \n\nVI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED\nONES DIE AS MARTYRS\n\n\tAfter the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he\nwill institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell,\nor eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be\nuseless.  \"And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and \nslave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that\nno one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, \nor the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding\ncalculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number\nis 666\" - Revelation 13:16-18.  \n\tThe Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of \nhumanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed\nin the past, such as the Holocaust.\n[or maybe the crusades? -M]\nYou cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's\nrule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) \"...I saw\nunder the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and\nfor the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of \nthem: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, \nuntil both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be\nkilled as they were, was completed.\" Revelation 6:9, 11.\n\tHis targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image\nor take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ \"...And I saw the souls of \nthose who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of \nGod, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark\non their foreheads or on the hands.\" - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every\nform of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor\nwill he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, \ntorturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take\nthe mark.  \n\tIf you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,\nyou will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.\n[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]\nYou cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and\ngain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake\nof Fire.  \"...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his \nmark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of\nthe wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His \nindignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the \npresence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.\" -Revelation \n14:9-10 \n\n[and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to\nthe first 5,000 at the stadium --M] \n\nVII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL\n\n\tAlthough you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist's government\nuntil the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is \nimportant for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are\nextremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.\n\tThe first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or\nmountainous area, for the Antichrist's control will come last to the least\npopulated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay \nattuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.\n[\"As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep\ninto our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school\nclosings\" --M] \nStore water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without\nthe mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste\nfrom nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.\n[Get a good water filter. --M]\nBring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,\nbatteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to \nsurvive and live off the land as the pioneers did.\n\nVIII. TRUST NO ONE\n\t\n\tThere will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist's\ngovernment.  Be on the lookout.\n[Perot supporters take note --M]\n\nIX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST\n\n\tIt is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,\nfor he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will\nbring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel \n11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a\nhalf years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be \nphysically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and \npersonality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic\nexpert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which\nhe will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural \npower that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will\nbe deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.\n[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]\n\tThe antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who\nwill make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  \nAll who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and\na half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.\n\nX. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!\n\n\tThe seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of\nChrist.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you \nwill be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  \n\tStart reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of \nyour sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take\nthe mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or\nremain saved, but this time you will have to be \"faithful unto death.\"\n\n\tMay God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!\n\n******************************************************************************\nMike Cluff\t\t\t\t*  \"Christianity is Stupid.\nv22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms\t*   Give up.\" -Negativland\nUB Language Perception Laboratory\t*  \n******************************************************************************\n\n\n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\ \n\nBob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM \n\nThey said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,\nand sank Manhattan out at sea.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n", "true_class": 0, "title": "ID 94 (FP)"}, {"text": "From: shellgate!llo@uu4.psi.com (Larry L.

Unfortunately\nthere are a number of possible definitions.  Starting from the \nbroadest, commonly used definitions are:\n\n  a historical definition\n  people who accept Christ as Lord and savior\n  a broad doctrinal definition\n  narrow doctrinal definitions\n\n1) By a historical definition I mean the sort of definition a secular\nhistorian would likely use.  This would include any group that\ndeveloped out of the Christian church, and continues within the same\nbroad culture.  E.g. some Unitarians would fail just about any\ndoctrinal test you could come up with.  Yet it's clear that that group\ndeveloped from Christianity, and people from very different\nbackgrounds (e.g. Hindus) would likely see them as part of\nChristianity.  This is not a definition most Christians like, but it's\nrelevant in some political and ethnic contexts.\n\n2) Accepting Christ as Lord and savior is a test used by many\nChristian groups for membership, e.g. the Southern Baptists and\nPresbyterian Church (USA).  I would qualify it by saying that what\nmost people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to Christ, so that\nsomeone who accepted Christ as one of many gods would not fit.  It's\nan attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not based\non technical doctrine.  By this definition, groups such as Arians\nwould be viewed as heretical Christians, but still Christians.  In the\nmodern context this would include Mormons, JW's, and \"oneness\nPentecostals\".  They would be viewed as heretical Christians, but\nstill Christian.  In practice I believe just about everyone who falls\ninto this category would accept the Apostle's Creed.\n\n3) The next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition,\nwhich includes all of the major strands of Christianity, but excludes\ngroups that are felt to be outside \"historic Christianity.\"  This is\nof course a slippery enterprise, since Catholics could argue that\nProtestants are outside historic Christianity, etc.  But I think the\nmost commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the\nNicene Creed and the Formula of Chalcedon.  The attempt is to\ncharacterize doctrines that all major strands of Christianity agree\nare key.  Obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement.  A\nMormon will regard the LDS church as a major strand, and thus will not\nwant to include anything that contradicts their beliefs.  But I think\nthis definition would have fairly broad acceptance.\n\n4) Finally, some people use definitions that I would say are limited\nto a specific Christian tradition.  E.g. some evangelicals only\nconsider someone Christian if he has had an evangelical-style\nconversion experience, and some I've even heard of groups that limit\nit to their specific church.\n\nI think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used.\nA lot is going to depend upon the purpose you're using it for.  If\nyou're using it descriptively, e.g. in history or anthropology, you'll\nprobably use definition 1 or 2.  If you're using it normatively, i.e.\nto say what you believe the Christian message is, you'll probably use\na definition like 3 or even 4.\n\n--clh]\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 8 (TP)"}, {"text": "From: Eugene.Bigelow@ebay.sun.com (Geno )\nSubject: Re: The doctrine of Original Sin\nReply-To: Eugene.Bigelow@ebay.sun.com\nOrganization: Sun Microsystems, Inc.\nLines: 9\n\n\n creps@lateran.ucs.indiana.edu (Stephen A.

Dr. James DeYoung; #3]\n\nR. Scroggs\n\n     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and\nsuggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a\n\"Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic\nterminology.\"  The term is derived from Lev 18\"22 & 20:13 where the LXX\njuxtaposes the two words arsenos (\"male\") and koiten (\"bed\"), and represents\nthe Hebrew miskab zabar (\"lying with a male\").   Yet he believes that Paul did\nnot originate the term, but borrowed it from \"circles of Hellenistic Jews\nacquainted with rabbinic discussions\" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid\n\"contact with the usual Greek terminology\" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs\nobserves, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions\nof pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to\nnative-speaking Greeks (108).\n\n     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the\nobject of the second part, thus differing from Boswell's \"learned discussion\"\n(107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of \"one who lies with a\nmale\" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9),\nwhich Scroggs interprets as \"the effeminate call-boy,\" arsenokoitai is the\nactive partner \"who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress' or who hires him on\noccasion to satisfy his sexual desires\" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not\nrefer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic\nmodel of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he\naffirms (109).\n     This is Scrogg's interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The\ncombination of pornoi (\"fornicators\"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai (\"slave\ndealers\") refers to \"male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave\ndealers [who procure them]\" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of\npederasty \"which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual\npurposes, and the use of these boys by adult males\" (121).  Even \"serious\nminded pagan authors\" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these\ninstances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently\ngeneral condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. \nConsequently Paul \"Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind\" (122).\nWe cannot know what Paul would have said about the \"contemporary model of\nadult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships\" (122).\n\n     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical\nconcerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of\nvices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and\nfunction of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any\nrelationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually\nnonexistent.  He concludes that Paul \"does not care about any specific item in\nthe lists\" (104). \n\n     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary\nphenomenon of a \"catalogue of vices,\"  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are\n\"irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today\" (129).  The \"model\nin today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model\nattacked by the NT\" that \"Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not\nrelevant to today's debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational\ndiscussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify\nrefusal of ordination. . . \" (127).\n\n      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI\n\nD. Wright\n\n     In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have\ncome under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell's\nview is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out\nseveral shortcomings of Boswell's treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults\nBoswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev\n18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the \"Apostolic\nConstitutions,\"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). \nBoswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term\nderives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This\nis significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell's\nclaim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the\ngender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean \"a male who sleeps with\na male,\" making arseno- the object.\n\n     Wright also faults Boswell's claims regarding linguistic features of the\nterm, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that\ncompounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it\nas an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely\none of dialectical diversity: \"No semantic import attaches to the difference\nbetween the two forms\" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which\nthe second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its\nobject and where \"the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its\ngender\" (132). \n\n     It is with Boswell's treatment of the early church fathers that Wright\ntakes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. \nFor example, Aristides' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis,\nandrobaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male\nhomosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell's discussion.  Boswell fails to cite\nHippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the\nSyriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to\nthe Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34). \n\n     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in\nparallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the\ndominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this\nparallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia (\"adultery\"), porneia\n(\"fornication\"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris\n(136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the\nTen Commandments as \"You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis (\"you shall not commit\nadultery\"), ou paidophthoreseis (\"you shall not practice homosexuality with\nboys\"), you shall not steal. . .\" (150 n. 43).\n\n     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein (\"commit homosexuality\") exists in the\nSibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was\ncoined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by\nOr.Sib., book 2 (137-38).\n\n     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew\nupon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John\nthe Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of\nhomosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.\n\n     Wright next replies to Boswell's contention that the term would not be\nabsent \"from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted\n(140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to\nthe first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used\ndozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g.\nDidache) show no acquaintance with Paul's letters or deliberately avoid citing\nScripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). \n\n     Boswell's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright's attention\n(141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom,\nomitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a\nlong uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom\n1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom's infrequent use of the term.  Wright\nobserves that Boswell has \"signally failed to demonstrate any us of\narsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual\nactivity\" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature\nand the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly\nspecified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world. \n\n     Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim\nand I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning\n\"homosexual\" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of\nthe word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell's limited\nconclusion based on them.\n\n     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the\ncatalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed\nin late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of\nhomosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the\npart of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into\nbeing under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke \"generally of\nmale activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual\nengagement with paides\" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were\ninterchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).\n\n     In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning\nhomosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and\nothers who limit the term to \"active male prostitutes\" or pederasty are without\nsignificant support from linguistic and historical studies.  \n\n[Next: the questioning of Wrights position by William Peterson.  After that, we\nget into the \"good\" stuff of historical & linguistic studies.  THis will\ninclude \"Symposium\" by Plato.  If there is any doubt as to the modern\nunderstanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time of\nPaul, this will certainly clear things up.  Also we will review Paul's use of\nLev18-20 in the NT and how, as for him, 1) the Law was fulfilled, but not done\naway with, 2) Lev 18-20 was the universal and the following chapters the\ngeneral.  Those who put forth that the OT no longer holds true today in our\nculture, should stick around for this one.]\n___________________________\n13 R. Scroggs, THe New Testament and Homosexuality (Phil: 1983) 86, 107-8. \nIndependently we came to the same conclusion.  Apparently the connection is\nmade in E.A. Sophocles, Greek Lexicon of the Roman & Byzantine Periods (from\n146BC to AD 1100).\n14   See discussion, 101-4.  He says the same thing about Paul's language in\nRom 1:26-27 (128).  But this is doubtful.  See the more cautious words of P.\nZaas, \"I Cor 6.9ff: Was Homosexuality Condoned in the Corinthian Church? SBLASP\n17 (1979):205-12.  He observes that the words moixai, malakoi, and arsenokoitai\nwere part of Jewish anti-Gentile polemic.  Yet Paul's wors at the end of the\nvice list, \"and such were some of you,\" indicate that \"Paul is addressing real\nor potential abuses of his ethical message, not citing primitive tradition by\nrote\" (210).  Wright disputes Zaas' attempt to associate the term with idolatry\n(147).\n15  On Boswell's treatment of Rom 1:26-7, the article by R.B. Hays, \"Relations\nNatural and Unnatural\"  A Response to John Boswell's Exegesis of Romans 1,\" JRE\n14/1 (Spring 1986): 184-215, is an excellent critique.\n16  D.F. Wright, \"Homosexuals or Prostitutes?  The Meaning of ARSENOKOITAI (I\nCor 6:9, I Tim 1:10), VC 38 (1984):125-53.\n17  In an unpublished paper, Henry Mendell, \"ARSENOKOITAI: Boswell on Paul,\"\neffectively refutres Boswell's claims regarding the philology of arsenokoitai. \nHe finds the meaning to be general, \"a male who has sex with a male\" (4-11).  \n18  Wright's endnotes (148-49) list additional sources in the church fathers.\n19   We also have noticed the same tendency by Boswell to fail to cite all the\nreferences to Sodom and sodomy in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha.  See  J.B.\nDeYoung, \"A Critique of Prohomosexual Interpretations of the OT Apocrypha and\nPseudepigrapha,\" BSac 146/588 (1990):437-53.\n20   In light of the claim made by Boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitai\npoints to a meaning lacking homosexual significance, Wright asks pertinently\n\"why neither Philo nor Josephus use  paidofthoria, nor Josephus paiderastia,\nand why . . Clement did not use the latter and Chrysostom the former?\"  (152 n.\n71)  In a more recent article, \"Homosexuality: The Relevance of the Bible,\" EvQ\n61 (1989):291-300, Wright reiterates these same points.  Paul shows a\n\"remarkable originality\" in extending the OT ethic to the church (300).\n\n \n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 12 (TP)"}, {"text": "From: agr00@ccc.amdahl.com (Anthony G Rose)\nSubject: Re: _Christianity In Crisis_ by Hank Hanegraaff\nReply-To: agr00@juts.ccc.amdahl.com (Anthony G Rose)\nOrganization: Amdahl Corporation, Sunnyvale CA\nLines: 22\n\nIn article <May.12.04.27.23.1993.9926@athos.rutgers.edu> af664@yfn.ysu.edu (Frank DeCenso, Jr.) writes:\n>Has anyone read this important book?

For\nthat matter, why didn't Mary's grandmother have to be without sin\neither?  Seems to me that with all the original sin flowing\nthrough each person, the need for the last one (Mary) to have\nnone puts God in a box, where we say that He couldn't have\nincarnated Himself through a normal human being.\n\nMy God is an all powerful God, Who can do whatever suits His\npurpose.  This includes creating a solar system and planet earth\nwith the appearance of great age; providing a path through the\nRed Sea for the children of Israel that does not depend on the\nexistence of a ridge of high ground and a wind blowing at the\nright speed and direction; and the birth of Himself from a normal\nsinful person without being tainted by her original sin.\n\nI see far too much focus on the \"objects\" of religion and not\nnearly enough on the personal relationship that is available to\nall believers with the Author of our existence, without the\nnecessity of having this relationship channeled through conduits\nto God in the form of Mary, Apostles and a Pope.\n\n: Note that the idea of Mary being conceived without Original Sin, i.e. the\n: Immaculate Conception, is distinct from the idea of Mary not having sinned\n: during her lifetime, which is a separate doctrine and, I believe, also\n: held by the Catholic Church.\n\nIf Mary was born without original sin, and didn't sin during her\nlifetime, how is she any different from Jesus?

A generation\nbefore the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh,\ngateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather\nthan God's way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which would\nhave given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored their\ndecision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the\nland of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision-\nmakers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and\ndestined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the\ntime they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderers\nhad been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with a\nsigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they\nwere going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence.\nWhatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached\nbones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression of\nhopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nation\nat Kadesh and had God' s promise of one day entering the land. The\nforty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, those\nwho were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the\ninheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Moses\nprays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over.\nAll these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining\npeople through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden.\nHis was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but\nhe also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem was\nthat they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. \"Who is your\nGod?\" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. When\nAaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or young\nbull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bull\nwho had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt's gods as He led\nIsrael to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles grow\nthin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and water\ngushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the\nGod of Almightiness becomes \"ho-hum --What' s next on the miracle menu?\"\nAnd a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He might\nbe all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a right\nto do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these people\nhad known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men's lives had hung\non the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believed\nGod could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIM\nand, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, His\nacts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From the\nday of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God.\nAt Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. He\nhad seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. This\nrequest was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God's glorious\nPerson. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and\nlovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word \"lovingkindness\" is not to be\nunderstood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationship\narising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as the\nlove that says, \"I will never leave you nor forsake you.\" Lovingkindness is as\ntenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its\nheels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based on\nfeelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and,\ntherefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God's love is not an emotion\nthat wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our\nhighest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. God\ndoes not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings\nof love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with\nus! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Him\nto reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- not\nbecause of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committed\nto us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He will\nnot let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us--\nbut a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It is\nsaying to the recipient, \"For as long as we shall live, I am for you.\"  The God\nwho has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--in\nHis coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who is\nlovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will never\nleave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him as\nlove; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeing\nmiracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in the\nheart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power.\nMoses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had for\nthese people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, they\ncould not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born out\nof knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One who\ngives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is to\nmiss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  If\nman is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on\nknowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues from\nlove demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years of\nmeaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to\nknow the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and the\npossibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. The\nlanguage Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its\nmother's love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It is\nwaking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for,\nprotected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we were\nto ask, \"What has the baby done to deserve this?\" or, \"Have arrangements\nbeen made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?\" Our\nquestions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child was\nconceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love's excitement, a love\nthat has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents' love is\nunconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child\nor its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally,\nspontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after\nHis image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the\nLord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to\nearn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identity\nthrough the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents' love. It is a\nscientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if\nit survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has been\nheld and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the\nembrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the new\ngeneration will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in\nthe love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and\ngladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His\nlove. \"Satisfied.\" in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing\nbeing filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describe\nthe earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received\nenough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be\ndrenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is the\nlifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in our\ndeepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems\ndisappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling\nthat he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make\nsense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks this\nsatisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the\nemotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in\nreligious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding\nto the love of the living God. Only in knowing God's love will the rest of life\nmake sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again\nbecame the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find it\nfascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His\nlove. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one would\nthink he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by\nthe knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knew\nbetter. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won't\nfind it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to\nmanipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and\ngive us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyes\nand satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking God\nto make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses' prayer was partially\nanswered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which\nworked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in its\nfullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out the\nlove of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church,\nwe read of the Holy Spirit \"falling upon\" the believers. This is an ancient\nexpression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used in\nLuke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and \"falling on his\nneck and kissing him.\" The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest\nself and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your\nbeing. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes.\nMoses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization\nthat we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taught\nus to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in a\nstate of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance\nand love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive love\nwe cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the Holy\nSpirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness to\nthink on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jaded\nwith the doctrine of \"perform to be accepted.\" We begin to realize that He\nloves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challenge\neveryone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your\neyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may not\nfeel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed the\nother day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians kept\nbehind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rays\nwithout being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing\nthat we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according to\nMoses, \"joy and gladness all our days.\" Joy is the result of a life that is\nfunctioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might say\nthat joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. Man' s highest\nperformance is to rest in the love God has for him... the hum will be joy, and\nthe result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now\nhas in life. Stop wandering in the wilderness. Be satisfied with His love and,\nin joy, day by day, receive all His promised blessings.\n\n\n----- End Included Message -----\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 18 (TP)"}, {"text": "From: u2i02@seq1.cc.keele.ac.uk (RJ Pomeroy)\nSubject: Re: Catholic doctrine of predestination\nLines: 36\n\nFrom article <May.13.02.28.48.1993.1471@geneva.rutgers.edu>, by creps@lateran.ucs.indiana.edu (Stephen A.

Karma is considered to\nbe a moral process in which intentions (either good or evil) shape\na person's predilections for future intention and action and\nproduce a person who is more prone to good than evil, or the opposite --\n\"reward\" has nothing to do with it.

But if you can contrive\nto control the action in dreams or do an OOBE, it seems like a morality applies.\n\nNow, there seem to be 3 alternatives:\n\n1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.  In this case no morality\napplies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene', that is, not trying\nto think about anything evil, or indulgining in overly sexy or violent\nthoughts.\n\n2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane')\nEvidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in\ncommon by more than one person.  A\nmark of objective fact is that >1 people report the same objective experience.\nIn this case, the same interpersonal morality/ethics applies in dreams and\nOOBEs as does in waking life.\n\n3) Like (2), but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have a\nreal existence, a different moral/ethics apply there, and no (or maybe \ndifferent) moral laws apply there.\n\nSo...

I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of\nactivity that could be named by \"fornication\" or \"theft\" or \"coveting\" or\n\"reviling\" or \"drunkenness\" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may\nor may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very\nfact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at\nall \"clear\" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest\nin MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,\nwith all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated\nChristian discussion of ALL these areas.\n\nHomosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I\nknow) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and\nchild molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly\n\"harmless\" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --\nthat would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter\nyou cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that\nyou want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]\n\n\t\"'I am free to do anything,' you say.  Yes, but not everything\n\tis for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one\n\twill not let anything make free with me.\"  [1 Cor. 6:12]\n\nWhich is a restatement that we must have no other \"god\" before God.  A\ncommandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some\npeople are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.\nIt is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary\nargument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such\nbehavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers.\n\nI won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.\nFundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your\nassumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of\nlaws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of\nwhich Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine\nthem.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are \"moral\" and\nwhich ones are \"ritual.\"  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology\ncourse should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories\nin an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).\nAnd I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus\nfrom the \"ritual law\" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.\n\nI'm dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this\nmatter) about how \"repulsive\" and \"unnatural\" our acts are -- and what\ndo they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of\narbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating\ninsects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you\nsay that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part\nof the ritual law?\n\nFor those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\nbe \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\nit is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\ndetermine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the\nwhole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: \"No doubt I am free to do anything.\"\nBut Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,\nthe Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go\nthrough Leviticus and decide each \"command\" there on that basis, then\nyour own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this\ncontext, it is remarkably offensive to say:\n\n>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the\n>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.\n\nWell, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the\none that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously\n(though one can always find jokers) in \"defense\" of bestiality.  It is\nabsolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\nraise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\nadult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\nthan the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you\nare being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the\nworld.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not\nmine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in\nour culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing\nus as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means\nyou can think of to do so.\n\nJesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,\nthe central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to\nlove one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-\nians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get\nin return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.\n\nChristians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every\ncorner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same\nold verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never\neven read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with\nthe vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\nmanage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great\nemotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even\ntaking the trouble to find out what it is.\n\nSuch behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.\nWHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to\ncondemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN\nto BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?\nGod forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or\ncondemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in\ninsisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are\nSO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.\n\nWhy, for God's sake?\n\n\t\"For God did not send the Son into the world\n\tto condemn the world,\n\tbut that the world might be saved through him.\n\tWhoever believes in him is not condemned,\n\tbut whoever does not believe has already been condemned\n\tfor refusing to believe in the name of God's only Son.\n\tNow the judgment is this:\n\tthe light has come into the world,\n\tbut men have preferred darkness to light\n\tbecause their deeds were evil.\n\tFor everyone who practices wickedness\n\thates the light,\n\tand does not come near the light\n\tfor fear his deeds will be exposed.\n\tBut he who acts in truth\n\tcomes into the light,\n\tso that it may be sh0own\n\tthat his deeds are done in God.\"\tJohn 3:17-21\n\nFor long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from\nevil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and\nrejected.

Unfortunately\nthere are a number of possible definitions.  Starting from the \nbroadest, commonly used definitions are:\n\n  a historical definition\n  people who accept Christ as Lord and savior\n  a broad doctrinal definition\n  narrow doctrinal definitions\n\n1) By a historical definition I mean the sort of definition a secular\nhistorian would likely use.  This would include any group that\ndeveloped out of the Christian church, and continues within the same\nbroad culture.  E.g. some Unitarians would fail just about any\ndoctrinal test you could come up with.  Yet it's clear that that group\ndeveloped from Christianity, and people from very different\nbackgrounds (e.g. Hindus) would likely see them as part of\nChristianity.  This is not a definition most Christians like, but it's\nrelevant in some political and ethnic contexts.\n\n2) Accepting Christ as Lord and savior is a test used by many\nChristian groups for membership, e.g. the Southern Baptists and\nPresbyterian Church (USA).  I would qualify it by saying that what\nmost people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to Christ, so that\nsomeone who accepted Christ as one of many gods would not fit.  It's\nan attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not based\non technical doctrine.  By this definition, groups such as Arians\nwould be viewed as heretical Christians, but still Christians.  In the\nmodern context this would include Mormons, JW's, and \"oneness\nPentecostals\".  They would be viewed as heretical Christians, but\nstill Christian.  In practice I believe just about everyone who falls\ninto this category would accept the Apostle's Creed.\n\n3) The next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition,\nwhich includes all of the major strands of Christianity, but excludes\ngroups that are felt to be outside \"historic Christianity.\"  This is\nof course a slippery enterprise, since Catholics could argue that\nProtestants are outside historic Christianity, etc.  But I think the\nmost commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the\nNicene Creed and the Formula of Chalcedon.  The attempt is to\ncharacterize doctrines that all major strands of Christianity agree\nare key.  Obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement.  A\nMormon will regard the LDS church as a major strand, and thus will not\nwant to include anything that contradicts their beliefs.  But I think\nthis definition would have fairly broad acceptance.\n\n4) Finally, some people use definitions that I would say are limited\nto a specific Christian tradition.  E.g. some evangelicals only\nconsider someone Christian if he has had an evangelical-style\nconversion experience, and some I've even heard of groups that limit\nit to their specific church.\n\nI think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used.\nA lot is going to depend upon the purpose you're using it for.  If\nyou're using it descriptively, e.g. in history or anthropology, you'll\nprobably use definition 1 or 2.  If you're using it normatively, i.e.\nto say what you believe the Christian message is, you'll probably use\na definition like 3 or even 4.\n\n--clh]\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 8 (TP)"}, {"text": "From: darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au (Fred Rice)\nSubject: Re: Genocide is Caused by Atheism\nOrganization: Monash University, Melb., Australia.\nLines: 19\n\nIn <1993Apr19.140316.14872@cs.nott.ac.uk> eczcaw@mips.nott.ac.uk (A.Wainwright) writes:\n\n>In article <1993Apr19.112706.26911@monu6.cc.monash.edu.au>, darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au (Fred Rice) writes:\n\n>|> (Great respect or love for a particular person does not equal a form of\n>|> \"theism\".)\n>|> \n>|>  Fred Rice\n>|>  darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au   \n\n>Hmm.

Dr. James DeYoung; #3]\n\nR. Scroggs\n\n     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and\nsuggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a\n\"Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic\nterminology.\"  The term is derived from Lev 18\"22 & 20:13 where the LXX\njuxtaposes the two words arsenos (\"male\") and koiten (\"bed\"), and represents\nthe Hebrew miskab zabar (\"lying with a male\").   Yet he believes that Paul did\nnot originate the term, but borrowed it from \"circles of Hellenistic Jews\nacquainted with rabbinic discussions\" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid\n\"contact with the usual Greek terminology\" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs\nobserves, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions\nof pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to\nnative-speaking Greeks (108).\n\n     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the\nobject of the second part, thus differing from Boswell's \"learned discussion\"\n(107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of \"one who lies with a\nmale\" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9),\nwhich Scroggs interprets as \"the effeminate call-boy,\" arsenokoitai is the\nactive partner \"who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress' or who hires him on\noccasion to satisfy his sexual desires\" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not\nrefer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic\nmodel of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he\naffirms (109).\n     This is Scrogg's interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The\ncombination of pornoi (\"fornicators\"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai (\"slave\ndealers\") refers to \"male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave\ndealers [who procure them]\" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of\npederasty \"which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual\npurposes, and the use of these boys by adult males\" (121).  Even \"serious\nminded pagan authors\" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these\ninstances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently\ngeneral condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. \nConsequently Paul \"Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind\" (122).\nWe cannot know what Paul would have said about the \"contemporary model of\nadult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships\" (122).\n\n     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical\nconcerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of\nvices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and\nfunction of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any\nrelationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually\nnonexistent.  He concludes that Paul \"does not care about any specific item in\nthe lists\" (104). \n\n     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary\nphenomenon of a \"catalogue of vices,\"  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are\n\"irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today\" (129).  The \"model\nin today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model\nattacked by the NT\" that \"Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not\nrelevant to today's debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational\ndiscussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify\nrefusal of ordination. . . \" (127).\n\n      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI\n\nD. Wright\n\n     In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have\ncome under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell's\nview is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out\nseveral shortcomings of Boswell's treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults\nBoswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev\n18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the \"Apostolic\nConstitutions,\"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). \nBoswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term\nderives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This\nis significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell's\nclaim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the\ngender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean \"a male who sleeps with\na male,\" making arseno- the object.\n\n     Wright also faults Boswell's claims regarding linguistic features of the\nterm, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that\ncompounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it\nas an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely\none of dialectical diversity: \"No semantic import attaches to the difference\nbetween the two forms\" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which\nthe second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its\nobject and where \"the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its\ngender\" (132). \n\n     It is with Boswell's treatment of the early church fathers that Wright\ntakes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. \nFor example, Aristides' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis,\nandrobaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male\nhomosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell's discussion.  Boswell fails to cite\nHippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the\nSyriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to\nthe Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34). \n\n     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in\nparallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the\ndominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this\nparallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia (\"adultery\"), porneia\n(\"fornication\"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris\n(136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the\nTen Commandments as \"You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis (\"you shall not commit\nadultery\"), ou paidophthoreseis (\"you shall not practice homosexuality with\nboys\"), you shall not steal. . .\" (150 n. 43).\n\n     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein (\"commit homosexuality\") exists in the\nSibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was\ncoined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by\nOr.Sib., book 2 (137-38).\n\n     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew\nupon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John\nthe Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of\nhomosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.\n\n     Wright next replies to Boswell's contention that the term would not be\nabsent \"from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted\n(140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to\nthe first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used\ndozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g.\nDidache) show no acquaintance with Paul's letters or deliberately avoid citing\nScripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). \n\n     Boswell's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright's attention\n(141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom,\nomitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a\nlong uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom\n1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom's infrequent use of the term.  Wright\nobserves that Boswell has \"signally failed to demonstrate any us of\narsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual\nactivity\" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature\nand the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly\nspecified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world. \n\n     Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim\nand I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning\n\"homosexual\" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of\nthe word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell's limited\nconclusion based on them.\n\n     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the\ncatalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed\nin late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of\nhomosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the\npart of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into\nbeing under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke \"generally of\nmale activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual\nengagement with paides\" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were\ninterchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).\n\n     In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning\nhomosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and\nothers who limit the term to \"active male prostitutes\" or pederasty are without\nsignificant support from linguistic and historical studies.  \n\n[Next: the questioning of Wrights position by William Peterson.  After that, we\nget into the \"good\" stuff of historical & linguistic studies.  THis will\ninclude \"Symposium\" by Plato.  If there is any doubt as to the modern\nunderstanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time of\nPaul, this will certainly clear things up.  Also we will review Paul's use of\nLev18-20 in the NT and how, as for him, 1) the Law was fulfilled, but not done\naway with, 2) Lev 18-20 was the universal and the following chapters the\ngeneral.  Those who put forth that the OT no longer holds true today in our\nculture, should stick around for this one.]\n___________________________\n13 R. Scroggs, THe New Testament and Homosexuality (Phil: 1983) 86, 107-8. \nIndependently we came to the same conclusion.  Apparently the connection is\nmade in E.A. Sophocles, Greek Lexicon of the Roman & Byzantine Periods (from\n146BC to AD 1100).\n14   See discussion, 101-4.  He says the same thing about Paul's language in\nRom 1:26-27 (128).  But this is doubtful.  See the more cautious words of P.\nZaas, \"I Cor 6.9ff: Was Homosexuality Condoned in the Corinthian Church? SBLASP\n17 (1979):205-12.  He observes that the words moixai, malakoi, and arsenokoitai\nwere part of Jewish anti-Gentile polemic.  Yet Paul's wors at the end of the\nvice list, \"and such were some of you,\" indicate that \"Paul is addressing real\nor potential abuses of his ethical message, not citing primitive tradition by\nrote\" (210).  Wright disputes Zaas' attempt to associate the term with idolatry\n(147).\n15  On Boswell's treatment of Rom 1:26-7, the article by R.B. Hays, \"Relations\nNatural and Unnatural\"  A Response to John Boswell's Exegesis of Romans 1,\" JRE\n14/1 (Spring 1986): 184-215, is an excellent critique.\n16  D.F. Wright, \"Homosexuals or Prostitutes?  The Meaning of ARSENOKOITAI (I\nCor 6:9, I Tim 1:10), VC 38 (1984):125-53.\n17  In an unpublished paper, Henry Mendell, \"ARSENOKOITAI: Boswell on Paul,\"\neffectively refutres Boswell's claims regarding the philology of arsenokoitai. \nHe finds the meaning to be general, \"a male who has sex with a male\" (4-11).  \n18  Wright's endnotes (148-49) list additional sources in the church fathers.\n19   We also have noticed the same tendency by Boswell to fail to cite all the\nreferences to Sodom and sodomy in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha.  See  J.B.\nDeYoung, \"A Critique of Prohomosexual Interpretations of the OT Apocrypha and\nPseudepigrapha,\" BSac 146/588 (1990):437-53.\n20   In light of the claim made by Boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitai\npoints to a meaning lacking homosexual significance, Wright asks pertinently\n\"why neither Philo nor Josephus use  paidofthoria, nor Josephus paiderastia,\nand why . . Clement did not use the latter and Chrysostom the former?\"  (152 n.\n71)  In a more recent article, \"Homosexuality: The Relevance of the Bible,\" EvQ\n61 (1989):291-300, Wright reiterates these same points.  Paul shows a\n\"remarkable originality\" in extending the OT ethic to the church (300).\n\n \n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 12 (TP)"}, {"text": "From: bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM (Robert Beauchaine)\nSubject: Re: Who has read Rushdie's _The Satanic Verses_?\nOrganization: Tektronix Inc., Beaverton, Or.\nLines: 21\n\nIn article <EDM.93Apr20145436@gocart.twisto.compaq.com> edm@twisto.compaq.com (Ed McCreary) writes:\n>\n>While we're on the topic of books, has anyone else noticed that Paine's\n>\"The Age of Reason\" is hard to find.

A generation\nbefore the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh,\ngateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather\nthan God's way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which would\nhave given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored their\ndecision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the\nland of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision-\nmakers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and\ndestined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the\ntime they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderers\nhad been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with a\nsigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they\nwere going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence.\nWhatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached\nbones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression of\nhopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nation\nat Kadesh and had God' s promise of one day entering the land. The\nforty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, those\nwho were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the\ninheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Moses\nprays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over.\nAll these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining\npeople through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden.\nHis was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but\nhe also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem was\nthat they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. \"Who is your\nGod?\" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. When\nAaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or young\nbull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bull\nwho had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt's gods as He led\nIsrael to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles grow\nthin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and water\ngushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the\nGod of Almightiness becomes \"ho-hum --What' s next on the miracle menu?\"\nAnd a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He might\nbe all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a right\nto do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these people\nhad known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men's lives had hung\non the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believed\nGod could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIM\nand, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, His\nacts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From the\nday of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God.\nAt Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. He\nhad seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. This\nrequest was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God's glorious\nPerson. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and\nlovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word \"lovingkindness\" is not to be\nunderstood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationship\narising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as the\nlove that says, \"I will never leave you nor forsake you.\" Lovingkindness is as\ntenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its\nheels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based on\nfeelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and,\ntherefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God's love is not an emotion\nthat wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our\nhighest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. God\ndoes not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings\nof love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with\nus! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Him\nto reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- not\nbecause of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committed\nto us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He will\nnot let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us--\nbut a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It is\nsaying to the recipient, \"For as long as we shall live, I am for you.\"  The God\nwho has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--in\nHis coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who is\nlovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will never\nleave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him as\nlove; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeing\nmiracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in the\nheart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power.\nMoses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had for\nthese people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, they\ncould not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born out\nof knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One who\ngives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is to\nmiss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  If\nman is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on\nknowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues from\nlove demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years of\nmeaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to\nknow the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and the\npossibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. The\nlanguage Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its\nmother's love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It is\nwaking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for,\nprotected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we were\nto ask, \"What has the baby done to deserve this?\" or, \"Have arrangements\nbeen made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?\" Our\nquestions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child was\nconceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love's excitement, a love\nthat has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents' love is\nunconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child\nor its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally,\nspontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after\nHis image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the\nLord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to\nearn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identity\nthrough the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents' love. It is a\nscientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if\nit survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has been\nheld and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the\nembrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the new\ngeneration will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in\nthe love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and\ngladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His\nlove. \"Satisfied.\" in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing\nbeing filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describe\nthe earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received\nenough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be\ndrenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is the\nlifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in our\ndeepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems\ndisappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling\nthat he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make\nsense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks this\nsatisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the\nemotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in\nreligious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding\nto the love of the living God. Only in knowing God's love will the rest of life\nmake sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again\nbecame the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find it\nfascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His\nlove. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one would\nthink he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by\nthe knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knew\nbetter. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won't\nfind it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to\nmanipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and\ngive us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyes\nand satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking God\nto make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses' prayer was partially\nanswered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which\nworked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in its\nfullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out the\nlove of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church,\nwe read of the Holy Spirit \"falling upon\" the believers. This is an ancient\nexpression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used in\nLuke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and \"falling on his\nneck and kissing him.\" The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest\nself and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your\nbeing. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes.\nMoses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization\nthat we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taught\nus to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in a\nstate of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance\nand love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive love\nwe cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the Holy\nSpirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness to\nthink on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jaded\nwith the doctrine of \"perform to be accepted.\" We begin to realize that He\nloves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challenge\neveryone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your\neyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may not\nfeel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed the\nother day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians kept\nbehind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rays\nwithout being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing\nthat we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according to\nMoses, \"joy and gladness all our days.\" Joy is the result of a life that is\nfunctioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might say\nthat joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. Man' s highest\nperformance is to rest in the love God has for him... the hum will be joy, and\nthe result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now\nhas in life. Stop wandering in the wilderness. Be satisfied with His love and,\nin joy, day by day, receive all His promised blessings.\n\n\n----- End Included Message -----\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 18 (TP)"}, {"text": "From: frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O'Dwyer)\nSubject: Re: Societal basis for morality\nOrganization: Siemens-Nixdorf AG\nLines: 49\nNNTP-Posting-Host: d012s658.ap.mchp.sni.de\n\nIn article <1993Apr20.004119.6119@cnsvax.uwec.edu> nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu (David Nye) writes:\n\nYou asked me to look over here, but I was on my way back anyway :-)\n\n#[reply to cobb@alexia.lis.uiuc.edu (Mike Cobb)]\n# \n#>If morals come from what is societally accepted, why follow that?

I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of\nactivity that could be named by \"fornication\" or \"theft\" or \"coveting\" or\n\"reviling\" or \"drunkenness\" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may\nor may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very\nfact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at\nall \"clear\" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest\nin MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,\nwith all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated\nChristian discussion of ALL these areas.\n\nHomosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I\nknow) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and\nchild molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly\n\"harmless\" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --\nthat would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter\nyou cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that\nyou want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]\n\n\t\"'I am free to do anything,' you say.  Yes, but not everything\n\tis for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one\n\twill not let anything make free with me.\"  [1 Cor. 6:12]\n\nWhich is a restatement that we must have no other \"god\" before God.  A\ncommandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some\npeople are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.\nIt is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary\nargument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such\nbehavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers.\n\nI won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.\nFundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your\nassumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of\nlaws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of\nwhich Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine\nthem.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are \"moral\" and\nwhich ones are \"ritual.\"  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology\ncourse should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories\nin an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).\nAnd I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus\nfrom the \"ritual law\" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.\n\nI'm dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this\nmatter) about how \"repulsive\" and \"unnatural\" our acts are -- and what\ndo they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of\narbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating\ninsects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you\nsay that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part\nof the ritual law?\n\nFor those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\nbe \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\nit is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\ndetermine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the\nwhole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: \"No doubt I am free to do anything.\"\nBut Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,\nthe Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go\nthrough Leviticus and decide each \"command\" there on that basis, then\nyour own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this\ncontext, it is remarkably offensive to say:\n\n>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the\n>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.\n\nWell, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the\none that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously\n(though one can always find jokers) in \"defense\" of bestiality.  It is\nabsolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\nraise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\nadult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\nthan the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you\nare being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the\nworld.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not\nmine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in\nour culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing\nus as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means\nyou can think of to do so.\n\nJesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,\nthe central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to\nlove one another, and ALL else depends on that.

STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC\n\n\tYour natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to\npanic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get right\nwith God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your \nonly chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the \nTribulation.  \"But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be \nsaved.\" - Matthew 24:13\n\nII. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION\n\n\tThe Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of\nthe rapture until Christ's second coming.  Also know as \"the time of Jacob's\n(Israel's) trouble\" (Jere 30:7) and \"Daniel's Seventieth Week\" (Dan 9), this \nperiod will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.\n\nIII. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM\n\n\tSoon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community \n(the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will\nbe tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable \npossession during the Tribulation.\n\nIV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tSince all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it\nis imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can\nquote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, \nRevelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to\nunfold before you.  \n\nV. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tPray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray \nand pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual \nstrength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the\nsake of Christ.  \n\nVI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED\nONES DIE AS MARTYRS\n\n\tAfter the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he\nwill institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell,\nor eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be\nuseless.  \"And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and \nslave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that\nno one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, \nor the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding\ncalculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number\nis 666\" - Revelation 13:16-18.  \n\tThe Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of \nhumanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed\nin the past, such as the Holocaust.\n[or maybe the crusades? -M]\nYou cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's\nrule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) \"...I saw\nunder the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and\nfor the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of \nthem: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, \nuntil both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be\nkilled as they were, was completed.\" Revelation 6:9, 11.\n\tHis targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image\nor take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ \"...And I saw the souls of \nthose who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of \nGod, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark\non their foreheads or on the hands.\" - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every\nform of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor\nwill he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, \ntorturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take\nthe mark.  \n\tIf you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,\nyou will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.\n[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]\nYou cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and\ngain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake\nof Fire.  \"...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his \nmark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of\nthe wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His \nindignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the \npresence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.\" -Revelation \n14:9-10 \n\n[and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to\nthe first 5,000 at the stadium --M] \n\nVII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL\n\n\tAlthough you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist's government\nuntil the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is \nimportant for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are\nextremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.\n\tThe first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or\nmountainous area, for the Antichrist's control will come last to the least\npopulated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay \nattuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.\n[\"As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep\ninto our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school\nclosings\" --M] \nStore water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without\nthe mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste\nfrom nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.\n[Get a good water filter. --M]\nBring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,\nbatteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to \nsurvive and live off the land as the pioneers did.\n\nVIII. TRUST NO ONE\n\t\n\tThere will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist's\ngovernment.  Be on the lookout.\n[Perot supporters take note --M]\n\nIX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST\n\n\tIt is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,\nfor he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will\nbring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel \n11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a\nhalf years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be \nphysically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and \npersonality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic\nexpert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which\nhe will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural \npower that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will\nbe deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.\n[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]\n\tThe antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who\nwill make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  \nAll who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and\na half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.\n\nX. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!\n\n\tThe seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of\nChrist.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you \nwill be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  \n\tStart reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of \nyour sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take\nthe mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or\nremain saved, but this time you will have to be \"faithful unto death.\"\n\n\tMay God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!\n\n******************************************************************************\nMike Cluff\t\t\t\t*  \"Christianity is Stupid.\nv22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms\t*   Give up.\" -Negativland\nUB Language Perception Laboratory\t*  \n******************************************************************************\n\n\n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\ \n\nBob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM \n\nThey said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,\nand sank Manhattan out at sea.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n", "true_class": 0, "title": "ID 94 (FP)"}, {"text": "From: hudson@athena.cs.uga.edu (Paul Hudson Jr)\nSubject: Re: homosexual issues in Christianity\nOrganization: University of Georgia, Athens\nLines: 38\n\nIn article <May.13.02.31.26.1993.1577@geneva.rutgers.edu> mls@panix.com (Michael Siemon) writes:\n>>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the\n>>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.\n\n> It is\n>absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\n>raise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\n>adult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\n>than the laws of kashrut.

This is very important.\nAnyone who would want to say that this command against homosexuality\ndeals with temple prostitution (and I think you would agree that there\nis no proof for this.)

As the\nprevious discussion of the Trinity did not lend itself to an exchange\nof flames, I am hopeful that this will also not produce major\nflames.\n\nRegards,\n--\nLarry Autry\nSilicon Graphics, St. Louis\nautry@sgi.com \n\n\n\n[Often we get into discussions about who is Christian.  Unfortunately\nthere are a number of possible definitions.  Starting from the \nbroadest, commonly used definitions are:\n\n  a historical definition\n  people who accept Christ as Lord and savior\n  a broad doctrinal definition\n  narrow doctrinal definitions\n\n1) By a historical definition I mean the sort of definition a secular\nhistorian would likely use.  This would include any group that\ndeveloped out of the Christian church, and continues within the same\nbroad culture.  E.g. some Unitarians would fail just about any\ndoctrinal test you could come up with.  Yet it's clear that that group\ndeveloped from Christianity, and people from very different\nbackgrounds (e.g. Hindus) would likely see them as part of\nChristianity.  This is not a definition most Christians like, but it's\nrelevant in some political and ethnic contexts.\n\n2) Accepting Christ as Lord and savior is a test used by many\nChristian groups for membership, e.g. the Southern Baptists and\nPresbyterian Church (USA).  I would qualify it by saying that what\nmost people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to Christ, so that\nsomeone who accepted Christ as one of many gods would not fit.  It's\nan attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not based\non technical doctrine.  By this definition, groups such as Arians\nwould be viewed as heretical Christians, but still Christians.  In the\nmodern context this would include Mormons, JW's, and \"oneness\nPentecostals\".  They would be viewed as heretical Christians, but\nstill Christian.  In practice I believe just about everyone who falls\ninto this category would accept the Apostle's Creed.\n\n3) The next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition,\nwhich includes all of the major strands of Christianity, but excludes\ngroups that are felt to be outside \"historic Christianity.\"  This is\nof course a slippery enterprise, since Catholics could argue that\nProtestants are outside historic Christianity, etc.  But I think the\nmost commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the\nNicene Creed and the Formula of Chalcedon.  The attempt is to\ncharacterize doctrines that all major strands of Christianity agree\nare key.  Obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement.  A\nMormon will regard the LDS church as a major strand, and thus will not\nwant to include anything that contradicts their beliefs.  But I think\nthis definition would have fairly broad acceptance.\n\n4) Finally, some people use definitions that I would say are limited\nto a specific Christian tradition.  E.g. some evangelicals only\nconsider someone Christian if he has had an evangelical-style\nconversion experience, and some I've even heard of groups that limit\nit to their specific church.\n\nI think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used.\nA lot is going to depend upon the purpose you're using it for.  If\nyou're using it descriptively, e.g. in history or anthropology, you'll\nprobably use definition 1 or 2.  If you're using it normatively, i.e.\nto say what you believe the Christian message is, you'll probably use\na definition like 3 or even 4.\n\n--clh]\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 8 (TP)"}, {"text": "From: darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au (Fred Rice)\nSubject: Re: Genocide is Caused by Atheism\nOrganization: Monash University, Melb., Australia.\nLines: 19\n\nIn <1993Apr19.140316.14872@cs.nott.ac.uk> eczcaw@mips.nott.ac.uk (A.Wainwright) writes:\n\n>In article <1993Apr19.112706.26911@monu6.cc.monash.edu.au>, darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au (Fred Rice) writes:\n\n>|> (Great respect or love for a particular person does not equal a form of\n>|> \"theism\".)\n>|> \n>|>  Fred Rice\n>|>  darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au   \n\n>Hmm.

Dr. James DeYoung; #3]\n\nR. Scroggs\n\n     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and\nsuggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a\n\"Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic\nterminology.\"  The term is derived from Lev 18\"22 & 20:13 where the LXX\njuxtaposes the two words arsenos (\"male\") and koiten (\"bed\"), and represents\nthe Hebrew miskab zabar (\"lying with a male\").   Yet he believes that Paul did\nnot originate the term, but borrowed it from \"circles of Hellenistic Jews\nacquainted with rabbinic discussions\" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid\n\"contact with the usual Greek terminology\" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs\nobserves, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions\nof pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to\nnative-speaking Greeks (108).\n\n     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the\nobject of the second part, thus differing from Boswell's \"learned discussion\"\n(107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of \"one who lies with a\nmale\" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9),\nwhich Scroggs interprets as \"the effeminate call-boy,\" arsenokoitai is the\nactive partner \"who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress' or who hires him on\noccasion to satisfy his sexual desires\" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not\nrefer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic\nmodel of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he\naffirms (109).\n     This is Scrogg's interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The\ncombination of pornoi (\"fornicators\"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai (\"slave\ndealers\") refers to \"male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave\ndealers [who procure them]\" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of\npederasty \"which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual\npurposes, and the use of these boys by adult males\" (121).  Even \"serious\nminded pagan authors\" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these\ninstances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently\ngeneral condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. \nConsequently Paul \"Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind\" (122).\nWe cannot know what Paul would have said about the \"contemporary model of\nadult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships\" (122).\n\n     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical\nconcerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of\nvices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and\nfunction of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any\nrelationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually\nnonexistent.  He concludes that Paul \"does not care about any specific item in\nthe lists\" (104). \n\n     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary\nphenomenon of a \"catalogue of vices,\"  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are\n\"irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today\" (129).  The \"model\nin today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model\nattacked by the NT\" that \"Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not\nrelevant to today's debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational\ndiscussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify\nrefusal of ordination. . . \" (127).\n\n      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI\n\nD. Wright\n\n     In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have\ncome under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell's\nview is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out\nseveral shortcomings of Boswell's treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults\nBoswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev\n18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the \"Apostolic\nConstitutions,\"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). \nBoswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term\nderives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This\nis significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell's\nclaim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the\ngender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean \"a male who sleeps with\na male,\" making arseno- the object.\n\n     Wright also faults Boswell's claims regarding linguistic features of the\nterm, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that\ncompounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it\nas an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely\none of dialectical diversity: \"No semantic import attaches to the difference\nbetween the two forms\" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which\nthe second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its\nobject and where \"the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its\ngender\" (132). \n\n     It is with Boswell's treatment of the early church fathers that Wright\ntakes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. \nFor example, Aristides' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis,\nandrobaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male\nhomosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell's discussion.  Boswell fails to cite\nHippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the\nSyriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to\nthe Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34). \n\n     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in\nparallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the\ndominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this\nparallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia (\"adultery\"), porneia\n(\"fornication\"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris\n(136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the\nTen Commandments as \"You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis (\"you shall not commit\nadultery\"), ou paidophthoreseis (\"you shall not practice homosexuality with\nboys\"), you shall not steal. . .\" (150 n. 43).\n\n     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein (\"commit homosexuality\") exists in the\nSibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was\ncoined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by\nOr.Sib., book 2 (137-38).\n\n     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew\nupon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John\nthe Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of\nhomosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.\n\n     Wright next replies to Boswell's contention that the term would not be\nabsent \"from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted\n(140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to\nthe first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used\ndozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g.\nDidache) show no acquaintance with Paul's letters or deliberately avoid citing\nScripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). \n\n     Boswell's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright's attention\n(141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom,\nomitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a\nlong uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom\n1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom's infrequent use of the term.  Wright\nobserves that Boswell has \"signally failed to demonstrate any us of\narsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual\nactivity\" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature\nand the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly\nspecified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world. \n\n     Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim\nand I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning\n\"homosexual\" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of\nthe word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell's limited\nconclusion based on them.\n\n     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the\ncatalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed\nin late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of\nhomosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the\npart of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into\nbeing under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke \"generally of\nmale activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual\nengagement with paides\" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were\ninterchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).\n\n     In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning\nhomosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and\nothers who limit the term to \"active male prostitutes\" or pederasty are without\nsignificant support from linguistic and historical studies.  \n\n[Next: the questioning of Wrights position by William Peterson.  After that, we\nget into the \"good\" stuff of historical & linguistic studies.  THis will\ninclude \"Symposium\" by Plato.  If there is any doubt as to the modern\nunderstanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time of\nPaul, this will certainly clear things up.  Also we will review Paul's use of\nLev18-20 in the NT and how, as for him, 1) the Law was fulfilled, but not done\naway with, 2) Lev 18-20 was the universal and the following chapters the\ngeneral.  Those who put forth that the OT no longer holds true today in our\nculture, should stick around for this one.]\n___________________________\n13 R. Scroggs, THe New Testament and Homosexuality (Phil: 1983) 86, 107-8. \nIndependently we came to the same conclusion.  Apparently the connection is\nmade in E.A. Sophocles, Greek Lexicon of the Roman & Byzantine Periods (from\n146BC to AD 1100).\n14   See discussion, 101-4.  He says the same thing about Paul's language in\nRom 1:26-27 (128).  But this is doubtful.  See the more cautious words of P.\nZaas, \"I Cor 6.9ff: Was Homosexuality Condoned in the Corinthian Church? SBLASP\n17 (1979):205-12.  He observes that the words moixai, malakoi, and arsenokoitai\nwere part of Jewish anti-Gentile polemic.  Yet Paul's wors at the end of the\nvice list, \"and such were some of you,\" indicate that \"Paul is addressing real\nor potential abuses of his ethical message, not citing primitive tradition by\nrote\" (210).  Wright disputes Zaas' attempt to associate the term with idolatry\n(147).\n15  On Boswell's treatment of Rom 1:26-7, the article by R.B. Hays, \"Relations\nNatural and Unnatural\"  A Response to John Boswell's Exegesis of Romans 1,\" JRE\n14/1 (Spring 1986): 184-215, is an excellent critique.\n16  D.F. Wright, \"Homosexuals or Prostitutes?  The Meaning of ARSENOKOITAI (I\nCor 6:9, I Tim 1:10), VC 38 (1984):125-53.\n17  In an unpublished paper, Henry Mendell, \"ARSENOKOITAI: Boswell on Paul,\"\neffectively refutres Boswell's claims regarding the philology of arsenokoitai. \nHe finds the meaning to be general, \"a male who has sex with a male\" (4-11).  \n18  Wright's endnotes (148-49) list additional sources in the church fathers.\n19   We also have noticed the same tendency by Boswell to fail to cite all the\nreferences to Sodom and sodomy in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha.  See  J.B.\nDeYoung, \"A Critique of Prohomosexual Interpretations of the OT Apocrypha and\nPseudepigrapha,\" BSac 146/588 (1990):437-53.\n20   In light of the claim made by Boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitai\npoints to a meaning lacking homosexual significance, Wright asks pertinently\n\"why neither Philo nor Josephus use  paidofthoria, nor Josephus paiderastia,\nand why . . Clement did not use the latter and Chrysostom the former?\"  (152 n.\n71)  In a more recent article, \"Homosexuality: The Relevance of the Bible,\" EvQ\n61 (1989):291-300, Wright reiterates these same points.  Paul shows a\n\"remarkable originality\" in extending the OT ethic to the church (300).\n\n \n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 12 (TP)"}, {"text": "From: bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM (Robert Beauchaine)\nSubject: Re: Who has read Rushdie's _The Satanic Verses_?\nOrganization: Tektronix Inc., Beaverton, Or.\nLines: 21\n\nIn article <EDM.93Apr20145436@gocart.twisto.compaq.com> edm@twisto.compaq.com (Ed McCreary) writes:\n>\n>While we're on the topic of books, has anyone else noticed that Paine's\n>\"The Age of Reason\" is hard to find.

If you would like more info on the ministry,\nand/or would like to comment on whether you found this teaching beneficial,\ne-mail to Randy Hunt at rlhunt@hou.amoco.com.\n\n\nLOVE IN THE MORNING  (Psalm 90:14)\n\nby Malcolm Smith\n\nMoses wrote this prayer at a weary time in the history of Israel. A generation\nbefore the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh,\ngateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather\nthan God's way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which would\nhave given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored their\ndecision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the\nland of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision-\nmakers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and\ndestined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the\ntime they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderers\nhad been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with a\nsigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they\nwere going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence.\nWhatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached\nbones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression of\nhopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nation\nat Kadesh and had God' s promise of one day entering the land. The\nforty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, those\nwho were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the\ninheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Moses\nprays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over.\nAll these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining\npeople through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden.\nHis was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but\nhe also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem was\nthat they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. \"Who is your\nGod?\" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. When\nAaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or young\nbull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bull\nwho had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt's gods as He led\nIsrael to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles grow\nthin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and water\ngushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the\nGod of Almightiness becomes \"ho-hum --What' s next on the miracle menu?\"\nAnd a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He might\nbe all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a right\nto do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these people\nhad known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men's lives had hung\non the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believed\nGod could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIM\nand, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, His\nacts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From the\nday of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God.\nAt Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. He\nhad seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. This\nrequest was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God's glorious\nPerson. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and\nlovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word \"lovingkindness\" is not to be\nunderstood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationship\narising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as the\nlove that says, \"I will never leave you nor forsake you.\" Lovingkindness is as\ntenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its\nheels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based on\nfeelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and,\ntherefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God's love is not an emotion\nthat wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our\nhighest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. God\ndoes not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings\nof love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with\nus! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Him\nto reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- not\nbecause of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committed\nto us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He will\nnot let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us--\nbut a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It is\nsaying to the recipient, \"For as long as we shall live, I am for you.\"  The God\nwho has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--in\nHis coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who is\nlovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will never\nleave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him as\nlove; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeing\nmiracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in the\nheart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power.\nMoses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had for\nthese people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, they\ncould not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born out\nof knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One who\ngives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is to\nmiss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  If\nman is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on\nknowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues from\nlove demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years of\nmeaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to\nknow the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and the\npossibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. The\nlanguage Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its\nmother's love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It is\nwaking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for,\nprotected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we were\nto ask, \"What has the baby done to deserve this?\" or, \"Have arrangements\nbeen made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?\" Our\nquestions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child was\nconceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love's excitement, a love\nthat has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents' love is\nunconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child\nor its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally,\nspontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after\nHis image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the\nLord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to\nearn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identity\nthrough the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents' love. It is a\nscientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if\nit survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has been\nheld and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the\nembrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the new\ngeneration will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in\nthe love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and\ngladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His\nlove. \"Satisfied.\" in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing\nbeing filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describe\nthe earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received\nenough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be\ndrenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is the\nlifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in our\ndeepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems\ndisappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling\nthat he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make\nsense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks this\nsatisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the\nemotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in\nreligious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding\nto the love of the living God. Only in knowing God's love will the rest of life\nmake sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again\nbecame the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find it\nfascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His\nlove. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one would\nthink he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by\nthe knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knew\nbetter. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won't\nfind it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to\nmanipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and\ngive us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyes\nand satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking God\nto make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses' prayer was partially\nanswered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which\nworked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in its\nfullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out the\nlove of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church,\nwe read of the Holy Spirit \"falling upon\" the believers. This is an ancient\nexpression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used in\nLuke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and \"falling on his\nneck and kissing him.\" The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest\nself and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your\nbeing. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes.\nMoses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization\nthat we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taught\nus to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in a\nstate of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance\nand love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive love\nwe cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the Holy\nSpirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness to\nthink on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jaded\nwith the doctrine of \"perform to be accepted.\" We begin to realize that He\nloves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challenge\neveryone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your\neyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may not\nfeel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed the\nother day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians kept\nbehind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rays\nwithout being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing\nthat we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according to\nMoses, \"joy and gladness all our days.\" Joy is the result of a life that is\nfunctioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might say\nthat joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. Man' s highest\nperformance is to rest in the love God has for him... the hum will be joy, and\nthe result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now\nhas in life. Stop wandering in the wilderness. Be satisfied with His love and,\nin joy, day by day, receive all His promised blessings.\n\n\n----- End Included Message -----\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 18 (TP)"}, {"text": "From: frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O'Dwyer)\nSubject: Re: Societal basis for morality\nOrganization: Siemens-Nixdorf AG\nLines: 49\nNNTP-Posting-Host: d012s658.ap.mchp.sni.de\n\nIn article <1993Apr20.004119.6119@cnsvax.uwec.edu> nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu (David Nye) writes:\n\nYou asked me to look over here, but I was on my way back anyway :-)\n\n#[reply to cobb@alexia.lis.uiuc.edu (Mike Cobb)]\n# \n#>If morals come from what is societally accepted, why follow that?

And such were \n>some of you...\"  I Cor. 6:9-11.\n\nThe moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_\nin this.  I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of\nactivity that could be named by \"fornication\" or \"theft\" or \"coveting\" or\n\"reviling\" or \"drunkenness\" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may\nor may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very\nfact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at\nall \"clear\" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest\nin MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,\nwith all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated\nChristian discussion of ALL these areas.\n\nHomosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I\nknow) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and\nchild molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly\n\"harmless\" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --\nthat would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter\nyou cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that\nyou want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]\n\n\t\"'I am free to do anything,' you say.  Yes, but not everything\n\tis for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one\n\twill not let anything make free with me.\"  [1 Cor. 6:12]\n\nWhich is a restatement that we must have no other \"god\" before God.  A\ncommandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some\npeople are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.\nIt is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary\nargument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such\nbehavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers.\n\nI won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.\nFundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your\nassumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of\nlaws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of\nwhich Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine\nthem.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are \"moral\" and\nwhich ones are \"ritual.\"  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology\ncourse should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories\nin an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).\nAnd I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus\nfrom the \"ritual law\" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.\n\nI'm dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this\nmatter) about how \"repulsive\" and \"unnatural\" our acts are -- and what\ndo they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of\narbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating\ninsects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you\nsay that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part\nof the ritual law?\n\nFor those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\nbe \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\nit is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\ndetermine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the\nwhole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: \"No doubt I am free to do anything.\"\nBut Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,\nthe Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go\nthrough Leviticus and decide each \"command\" there on that basis, then\nyour own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this\ncontext, it is remarkably offensive to say:\n\n>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the\n>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.\n\nWell, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the\none that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously\n(though one can always find jokers) in \"defense\" of bestiality.  It is\nabsolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\nraise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\nadult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\nthan the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you\nare being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the\nworld.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not\nmine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in\nour culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing\nus as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means\nyou can think of to do so.\n\nJesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,\nthe central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to\nlove one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-\nians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get\nin return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.\n\nChristians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every\ncorner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same\nold verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never\neven read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with\nthe vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\nmanage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great\nemotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even\ntaking the trouble to find out what it is.\n\nSuch behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.\nWHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to\ncondemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN\nto BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?\nGod forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or\ncondemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in\ninsisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are\nSO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.\n\nWhy, for God's sake?\n\n\t\"For God did not send the Son into the world\n\tto condemn the world,\n\tbut that the world might be saved through him.\n\tWhoever believes in him is not condemned,\n\tbut whoever does not believe has already been condemned\n\tfor refusing to believe in the name of God's only Son.\n\tNow the judgment is this:\n\tthe light has come into the world,\n\tbut men have preferred darkness to light\n\tbecause their deeds were evil.\n\tFor everyone who practices wickedness\n\thates the light,\n\tand does not come near the light\n\tfor fear his deeds will be exposed.\n\tBut he who acts in truth\n\tcomes into the light,\n\tso that it may be sh0own\n\tthat his deeds are done in God.\"\tJohn 3:17-21\n\nFor long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from\nevil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and\nrejected.

Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed\nin the past, such as the Holocaust.\n[or maybe the crusades? -M]\nYou cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's\nrule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) \"...I saw\nunder the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and\nfor the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of \nthem: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, \nuntil both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be\nkilled as they were, was completed.\" Revelation 6:9, 11.\n\tHis targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image\nor take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ \"...And I saw the souls of \nthose who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of \nGod, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark\non their foreheads or on the hands.\" - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every\nform of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor\nwill he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, \ntorturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take\nthe mark.  \n\tIf you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,\nyou will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.\n[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]\nYou cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and\ngain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake\nof Fire.  \"...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his \nmark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of\nthe wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His \nindignation.

SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL\n\n\tAlthough you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist's government\nuntil the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is \nimportant for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are\nextremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.\n\tThe first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or\nmountainous area, for the Antichrist's control will come last to the least\npopulated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay \nattuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.\n[\"As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep\ninto our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school\nclosings\" --M] \nStore water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without\nthe mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste\nfrom nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.\n[Get a good water filter. --M]\nBring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,\nbatteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to \nsurvive and live off the land as the pioneers did.\n\nVIII. TRUST NO ONE\n\t\n\tThere will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist's\ngovernment.  Be on the lookout.\n[Perot supporters take note --M]\n\nIX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST\n\n\tIt is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,\nfor he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will\nbring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel \n11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a\nhalf years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be \nphysically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and \npersonality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic\nexpert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which\nhe will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural \npower that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will\nbe deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.\n[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]\n\tThe antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who\nwill make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  \nAll who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and\na half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.\n\nX. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!\n\n\tThe seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of\nChrist.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you \nwill be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  \n\tStart reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of \nyour sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take\nthe mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or\nremain saved, but this time you will have to be \"faithful unto death.\"\n\n\tMay God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!\n\n******************************************************************************\nMike Cluff\t\t\t\t*  \"Christianity is Stupid.\nv22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms\t*   Give up.\" -Negativland\nUB Language Perception Laboratory\t*  \n******************************************************************************\n\n\n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\ \n\nBob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM \n\nThey said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,\nand sank Manhattan out at sea.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n", "true_class": 0, "title": "ID 94 (TN-FP)"}, {"text": "From: mccullou@snake2.cs.wisc.edu (Mark McCullough)\nSubject: Re: Amusing atheists and anarchists\nOrganization: University of Wisconsin, Madison -- Computer Sciences Dept.\nLines: 31\n\nIn article <timmbake.735294667@mcl> timmbake@mcl.ucsb.edu (Bake Timmons) writes:\n>mccullou@whipple.cs.wisc.edu writes:\n>\n>>The line about atheists haveing something up their sleeves is what seemed\n>>to imply that.

A week ago, I managed to find time to consult\na Septuagint Concordance and a LXX text with apparatus at the library,\nand I can now usefully conclude my look at the Greek words for love as\nused in the Christian background of the Septuagintal translation of the\nJewish scriptures.\n\nThe principal result is that there is a cluster of uses of the verbal\nnoun from _erao:_, _eraste:s_ meaning \"lover.\"  This cluster occurs just\nwhere one might most expect it, in the propethic image (and accusation)\nof Israel as faithless spouse to YHWH.  The verses in question are Hosea\n2:5,7 & 10; Jeremiah 4:30, 22:20 & 22; Lamentations 1:19; and Ezekiel\n16:33, 36 &37 and 23:5, 9 & 22.\n\n\t[ Hosea seems to have originated this usage, which Jeremiah and\n\t  Ezekiel picked up;  Lamentations is dependent on, though not\n\t  likely written by, Jeremiah. ]\n\nThe \"erotic\" meaning (in its allegorical use, not at all literally) is\nevident.  So too in English, unless you complement it with a phrase like\n\"of the arts\" the word \"lover\" is going to have an overtone of sexual\nrelationship.  There is no surprise here, but it is worthwhile to see\nthat standard Greek usage *does* show up in the translations from the\nHebrew! :-)\n\nMore interestingly, and some confirmation of my guess that later Koine\nusage avoided the verb _erao:_ because of its homonymy to _ero:_ (say),\n_eromai_ (ask), there is an error in Codex Vaticanus (normally, a very\nvaluable witness) where a form of _erao:_ is used in a completely absurd\ncontext -- 2 Samuel 20:18, where the  meaning *must* be \"say.\"\n\nIn addition to the above (and the uses I have already mentioned in Proverbs),\nEsther 2:17 uses the verb in its most natural application, \n\n\tkai e:rasthe\" ho basileus Esthe:r  --  and the King loved Esther\n\nand, rather more interestingly, 1 Samuel 19:2 supplies a modest degree of\nsupport to the gay appraisal of the relationship of David and Jonathan:\n\n\tkai Io:nathan huios Saoul e:[i]reito ton Dauid sphodra\n\t-- and Jonathan, Saul's son, loved David intensely\n\n\t[ I'm using the bracketed [i] for io:ta subscript, which I\n\t  don't yet have a reasonable ASCII convention for. ]\n\n(The relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about\nthe \"historical\" facts, but just that a quasi-official translation of\nthe Hebrew text in the Hellenistic period makes no bones about using the\n\"erotic\" verb in this context.  Given the quite general usage of _agapao:_\nfor erotic senses, this need not mean anything \"more\" than _agapao:_ alone\nwould mean, but it DOES disambiguate the relationship, as far as this\ntranslator goes!)\n-- \nMichael L.

(I can supply the reference if anyone's interested.)\n\n5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.  So if\nyou're interested in examining the differences in the long recension\nan excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in:\n   \"A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT\", Bruce Metzger (United Bible\n   Society, 1971).\n\nMetzger's book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of\nthe Greek NT.

The longer version to which you refer is\nusually called the \"Western\" version and its main witness is the Codex\nBezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).\n\n7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark's edition\n(mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the\ntext edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains\n18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.\n\n8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations\nin the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The main\ndifference seems to \"expansion\" of detail in the Western text (or, if\nyou prefer \"contractions\" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seems\nto be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specific\ncases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.\n\n9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the\nmore authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anything\napproaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents\npurely the \"authentic\" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be\nexamined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the\nAlexandrian text is the \"better\" more often than not.\n\nN\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 145 (FN-TP)"}, {"text": "From: shellgate!llo@uu4.psi.com (Larry L.

As the\nprevious discussion of the Trinity did not lend itself to an exchange\nof flames, I am hopeful that this will also not produce major\nflames.\n\nRegards,\n--\nLarry Autry\nSilicon Graphics, St. Louis\nautry@sgi.com \n\n\n\n[Often we get into discussions about who is Christian.  Unfortunately\nthere are a number of possible definitions.  Starting from the \nbroadest, commonly used definitions are:\n\n  a historical definition\n  people who accept Christ as Lord and savior\n  a broad doctrinal definition\n  narrow doctrinal definitions\n\n1) By a historical definition I mean the sort of definition a secular\nhistorian would likely use.  This would include any group that\ndeveloped out of the Christian church, and continues within the same\nbroad culture.  E.g. some Unitarians would fail just about any\ndoctrinal test you could come up with.  Yet it's clear that that group\ndeveloped from Christianity, and people from very different\nbackgrounds (e.g. Hindus) would likely see them as part of\nChristianity.  This is not a definition most Christians like, but it's\nrelevant in some political and ethnic contexts.\n\n2) Accepting Christ as Lord and savior is a test used by many\nChristian groups for membership, e.g. the Southern Baptists and\nPresbyterian Church (USA).  I would qualify it by saying that what\nmost people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to Christ, so that\nsomeone who accepted Christ as one of many gods would not fit.  It's\nan attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not based\non technical doctrine.  By this definition, groups such as Arians\nwould be viewed as heretical Christians, but still Christians.  In the\nmodern context this would include Mormons, JW's, and \"oneness\nPentecostals\".  They would be viewed as heretical Christians, but\nstill Christian.  In practice I believe just about everyone who falls\ninto this category would accept the Apostle's Creed.\n\n3) The next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition,\nwhich includes all of the major strands of Christianity, but excludes\ngroups that are felt to be outside \"historic Christianity.\"  This is\nof course a slippery enterprise, since Catholics could argue that\nProtestants are outside historic Christianity, etc.  But I think the\nmost commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the\nNicene Creed and the Formula of Chalcedon.  The attempt is to\ncharacterize doctrines that all major strands of Christianity agree\nare key.  Obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement.  A\nMormon will regard the LDS church as a major strand, and thus will not\nwant to include anything that contradicts their beliefs.  But I think\nthis definition would have fairly broad acceptance.\n\n4) Finally, some people use definitions that I would say are limited\nto a specific Christian tradition.  E.g. some evangelicals only\nconsider someone Christian if he has had an evangelical-style\nconversion experience, and some I've even heard of groups that limit\nit to their specific church.\n\nI think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used.\nA lot is going to depend upon the purpose you're using it for.  If\nyou're using it descriptively, e.g. in history or anthropology, you'll\nprobably use definition 1 or 2.  If you're using it normatively, i.e.\nto say what you believe the Christian message is, you'll probably use\na definition like 3 or even 4.\n\n--clh]\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 8 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: kempmp@phoenix.oulu.fi (Petri Pihko)\nSubject: Re: Atheism survey\nOrganization: University of Oulu, Finland\nLines: 88\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL9]\n\nI replied to this query via e-mail, but I think there are some\nissues that are worth discussing in public.\n\nMTA (mtabbott@unix.amherst.edu) wrote:\n> I am doing research on atheism, part of which involves field research here\n> on the net.

No one has a proof one way or the other, but many people\nare interested in it!\n \nI've satisfied myself that nothing could indicate absolutely the\nexistence of God one way or the other.  The two possibilities\nare supernaturalism and naturalism.  Of course no set of circumstances can\nbe inconsistent with supernaturalism, but similarly, no set of circumstances\ncan be inconsistent with naturalism.  In naturalism, any phenomenon that\ncould be described as God is considered part of the natural world, to\nbe studied as any other natural phenomenon (gravity, for instance).  \nFor example, if a loud ``godlike'' voice vociferously announced, ``I\nam God, I exist, and I will prove it by reversing the force of gravity,''\nand if then gravity did indeed reverse, a naturalist (probably a scientist)\nwould say, ``Boy, we sure didn't understand gravity as well as we\nthought we did, and that loud voice is something new.  Perhaps we\ndidn't understand thunder as well as we thought we did either.''\n\n>I contend that proper implementation of the Christian faith requires\n>reasoning, but that reasoning cannot be used to throw out things you\n>don't like, or find uncomfortable.

But if you can contrive\nto control the action in dreams or do an OOBE, it seems like a morality applies.\n\nNow, there seem to be 3 alternatives:\n\n1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.  In this case no morality\napplies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene', that is, not trying\nto think about anything evil, or indulgining in overly sexy or violent\nthoughts.\n\n2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane')\nEvidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in\ncommon by more than one person.  A\nmark of objective fact is that >1 people report the same objective experience.\nIn this case, the same interpersonal morality/ethics applies in dreams and\nOOBEs as does in waking life.\n\n3) Like (2), but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have a\nreal existence, a different moral/ethics apply there, and no (or maybe \ndifferent) moral laws apply there.\n\nSo... There it is.

Dr. James DeYoung; #3]\n\nR. Scroggs\n\n     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and\nsuggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a\n\"Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic\nterminology.\"  The term is derived from Lev 18\"22 & 20:13 where the LXX\njuxtaposes the two words arsenos (\"male\") and koiten (\"bed\"), and represents\nthe Hebrew miskab zabar (\"lying with a male\").   Yet he believes that Paul did\nnot originate the term, but borrowed it from \"circles of Hellenistic Jews\nacquainted with rabbinic discussions\" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid\n\"contact with the usual Greek terminology\" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs\nobserves, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions\nof pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to\nnative-speaking Greeks (108).\n\n     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the\nobject of the second part, thus differing from Boswell's \"learned discussion\"\n(107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of \"one who lies with a\nmale\" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9),\nwhich Scroggs interprets as \"the effeminate call-boy,\" arsenokoitai is the\nactive partner \"who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress' or who hires him on\noccasion to satisfy his sexual desires\" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not\nrefer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic\nmodel of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he\naffirms (109).\n     This is Scrogg's interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The\ncombination of pornoi (\"fornicators\"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai (\"slave\ndealers\") refers to \"male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave\ndealers [who procure them]\" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of\npederasty \"which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual\npurposes, and the use of these boys by adult males\" (121).  Even \"serious\nminded pagan authors\" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these\ninstances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently\ngeneral condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. \nConsequently Paul \"Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind\" (122).\nWe cannot know what Paul would have said about the \"contemporary model of\nadult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships\" (122).\n\n     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical\nconcerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of\nvices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and\nfunction of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any\nrelationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually\nnonexistent.  He concludes that Paul \"does not care about any specific item in\nthe lists\" (104). \n\n     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary\nphenomenon of a \"catalogue of vices,\"  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are\n\"irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today\" (129).  The \"model\nin today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model\nattacked by the NT\" that \"Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not\nrelevant to today's debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational\ndiscussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify\nrefusal of ordination. . . \" (127).\n\n      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI\n\nD. Wright\n\n     In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have\ncome under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell's\nview is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out\nseveral shortcomings of Boswell's treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults\nBoswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev\n18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the \"Apostolic\nConstitutions,\"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). \nBoswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term\nderives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This\nis significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell's\nclaim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the\ngender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean \"a male who sleeps with\na male,\" making arseno- the object.\n\n     Wright also faults Boswell's claims regarding linguistic features of the\nterm, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that\ncompounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it\nas an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely\none of dialectical diversity: \"No semantic import attaches to the difference\nbetween the two forms\" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which\nthe second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its\nobject and where \"the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its\ngender\" (132). \n\n     It is with Boswell's treatment of the early church fathers that Wright\ntakes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. \nFor example, Aristides' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis,\nandrobaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male\nhomosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell's discussion.  Boswell fails to cite\nHippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the\nSyriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to\nthe Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34). \n\n     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in\nparallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the\ndominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this\nparallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia (\"adultery\"), porneia\n(\"fornication\"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris\n(136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the\nTen Commandments as \"You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis (\"you shall not commit\nadultery\"), ou paidophthoreseis (\"you shall not practice homosexuality with\nboys\"), you shall not steal. . .\" (150 n. 43).\n\n     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein (\"commit homosexuality\") exists in the\nSibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was\ncoined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by\nOr.Sib., book 2 (137-38).\n\n     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew\nupon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John\nthe Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of\nhomosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.\n\n     Wright next replies to Boswell's contention that the term would not be\nabsent \"from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted\n(140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to\nthe first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used\ndozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g.\nDidache) show no acquaintance with Paul's letters or deliberately avoid citing\nScripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). \n\n     Boswell's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright's attention\n(141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom,\nomitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a\nlong uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom\n1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom's infrequent use of the term.  Wright\nobserves that Boswell has \"signally failed to demonstrate any us of\narsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual\nactivity\" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature\nand the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly\nspecified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world. \n\n     Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim\nand I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning\n\"homosexual\" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of\nthe word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell's limited\nconclusion based on them.\n\n     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the\ncatalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed\nin late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of\nhomosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the\npart of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into\nbeing under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke \"generally of\nmale activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual\nengagement with paides\" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were\ninterchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).\n\n     In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning\nhomosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and\nothers who limit the term to \"active male prostitutes\" or pederasty are without\nsignificant support from linguistic and historical studies.  \n\n[Next: the questioning of Wrights position by William Peterson.  After that, we\nget into the \"good\" stuff of historical & linguistic studies.  THis will\ninclude \"Symposium\" by Plato.  If there is any doubt as to the modern\nunderstanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time of\nPaul, this will certainly clear things up.  Also we will review Paul's use of\nLev18-20 in the NT and how, as for him, 1) the Law was fulfilled, but not done\naway with, 2) Lev 18-20 was the universal and the following chapters the\ngeneral.  Those who put forth that the OT no longer holds true today in our\nculture, should stick around for this one.]\n___________________________\n13 R. Scroggs, THe New Testament and Homosexuality (Phil: 1983) 86, 107-8. \nIndependently we came to the same conclusion.  Apparently the connection is\nmade in E.A. Sophocles, Greek Lexicon of the Roman & Byzantine Periods (from\n146BC to AD 1100).\n14   See discussion, 101-4.  He says the same thing about Paul's language in\nRom 1:26-27 (128).  But this is doubtful.  See the more cautious words of P.\nZaas, \"I Cor 6.9ff: Was Homosexuality Condoned in the Corinthian Church? SBLASP\n17 (1979):205-12.  He observes that the words moixai, malakoi, and arsenokoitai\nwere part of Jewish anti-Gentile polemic.  Yet Paul's wors at the end of the\nvice list, \"and such were some of you,\" indicate that \"Paul is addressing real\nor potential abuses of his ethical message, not citing primitive tradition by\nrote\" (210).  Wright disputes Zaas' attempt to associate the term with idolatry\n(147).\n15  On Boswell's treatment of Rom 1:26-7, the article by R.B. Hays, \"Relations\nNatural and Unnatural\"  A Response to John Boswell's Exegesis of Romans 1,\" JRE\n14/1 (Spring 1986): 184-215, is an excellent critique.\n16  D.F. Wright, \"Homosexuals or Prostitutes?  The Meaning of ARSENOKOITAI (I\nCor 6:9, I Tim 1:10), VC 38 (1984):125-53.\n17  In an unpublished paper, Henry Mendell, \"ARSENOKOITAI: Boswell on Paul,\"\neffectively refutres Boswell's claims regarding the philology of arsenokoitai. \nHe finds the meaning to be general, \"a male who has sex with a male\" (4-11).  \n18  Wright's endnotes (148-49) list additional sources in the church fathers.\n19   We also have noticed the same tendency by Boswell to fail to cite all the\nreferences to Sodom and sodomy in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha.  See  J.B.\nDeYoung, \"A Critique of Prohomosexual Interpretations of the OT Apocrypha and\nPseudepigrapha,\" BSac 146/588 (1990):437-53.\n20   In light of the claim made by Boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitai\npoints to a meaning lacking homosexual significance, Wright asks pertinently\n\"why neither Philo nor Josephus use  paidofthoria, nor Josephus paiderastia,\nand why . . Clement did not use the latter and Chrysostom the former?\"  (152 n.\n71)  In a more recent article, \"Homosexuality: The Relevance of the Bible,\" EvQ\n61 (1989):291-300, Wright reiterates these same points.  Paul shows a\n\"remarkable originality\" in extending the OT ethic to the church (300).\n\n \n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 12 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: arc1@ukc.ac.uk (Tony Curtis)\nSubject: Re: Christian Morality is\nOrganization: Computing Laboratory, UKC\nLines: 41\nNntp-Posting-Host: pine.ukc.ac.uk\n\n\nacooper@mac.cc.macalstr.edu (Turin Turambar, ME Department of Utter Misery)\nsaid re.

Hislop's scholarship was\naccepted by the Bristish Oriental Institute which, at the time, was the premere\nInstitute for Oriental studies.  As I've stated over and over,  I've checked\nout about 25% of his references (most are now out of print or in private\nlibraries) and the likes of Wilkerson and Layard hold their own merit.  THey\ntoo came to the same conclusions and if you will trouble yourself, you will\nfind that their knowledge of the mysteries have yet to be surpassed.  Both were\nhighly honored by the British Oriental Museum.  Wilkerson is known as one of\nthe leading archeologist in the history of Egyptiology and Layard is still\nbeing refered two after 200 yrs of archeology in the Mesopotamian regions.  He\nwas recently refered to in a TIME article on Babylonian archeology.  \n\nPhony scholarship is when you review their references and find that they have\nmisquoted or misrepresented the conclusions.  Hislop did not.  His conclusions\ndo not tickle the ears, that much is self evident.  But to assert that his\nconclusions are \"spurious\" is without merit.  He gave references to all his\nconclusions and as I have stated, for the last 25 years I have used his\nconclusions in debates at RC seminaries and brotherhoods, not to mention the\nindividual priests and bishops that I have talked to one on one.  No counter to\nHislops scholarship was made.  The only rebuttals were against his conclusions\nbecause they do totally undermined the claims of the RCC. He was showing that\nthe intitution of the RCC was based on the mysteries (which others have shown\neven to this day in various articles and topics).  THe tongues movement in\nCorinth was a direct result of the mysteries entering into the church.  If it\nwas so in Corinth, why could they not have an influence in Rome, the city of\nseven hills?\n\nAlso, you do not have to listen to his conclusions, you can draw your own\nconclusions by looking at the customs, artifacts, the cerimonial dress, the\ndocrine of purgatory, etc from the vantage of the mysteries.  You don't even\nhave to be a believer to see the parallels.  Just one example.  THe mitre. \nWhere did it come from?  Why is it shaped the way it is?  What are the two\ntails that hang down the back represent?  Was this an ancient  head dress from\nan earlier culture and why was it in Rome at the time of the beginnings of the\nchurch of the State of Rome?  Does it have pagan history behind it, and if so,\nwhy did the RCC chose regardless?\n\nAny lay person of middle eastern religion can answer these questions.  Even the\nscriptures themselves refer to it.  All Hislop did was collect the information\nfrom all the various sources and put them in one binding.  There is no lack of\nscholorship in that.\n\nPlease tell me why you discredit this man by your accusation, yet present no\nevidence supporting it.  \n\n--Rex\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 249 (FN-TP)"}, {"text": "From: mdw@sitar.hr.att.com (Mark Wuest)\nSubject: Re: The doctrine of Original Sin\nOrganization: AT&T\nLines: 53\n\nIn article <May.11.02.38.56.1993.28319@athos.rutgers.edu> Eugene.Bigelow@ebay.sun.com writes:\n\n>>Eugene Bigelow writes:\n\n>>>Doesn't the Bible say that God is a fair god [sic]?

Thus, some atheism might result from \n>broken-ness.\n\nI'd like to field this one, if I may.  Although I am a believer in and follower\nof Christ, my experiences with religion haven't been all that positive.  In\nfact, there was one point in my life when, for about three days, I simply\n_couldn't_ believe in the existence of God.  Anyway, when I look back upon the\ntroubles I've had, they seem to fall into two categories -- impulses to\nunbelief that resulted from logical contradictions, and impulses to unbelief\nthat resulted from frustration with God.\n\nThe first category doesn't occur to me much anymore, as I have worked through\nmost of the arguments for the non-existence of God.  But way back when, these\nwould cause me some problems, and I would have to struggle with my faith to\ncontinue to believe.  I can see where others less stubborn than I (and I do\nmean stubborn.  Stubborness has often been the only thing standing between\nme an atheism from time to time) would fail.\n\nThe second category arises out of some long-term personal difficulties and\nthe struggle to live my life as God would have me live it WITHOUT living my \nlife as others would tell me how God would have me live it.  A good example of\nthis is my struggle with the more radical Christians I meet.  I am not, nor\nhave I ever been, \"on fire for Chirst,\" and I don't think I ever want to be.\nNevertheless, I am not \"lukewarm\" about my faith, so I don't really\nfit in with the mainstream either.  Quite naturally, I feel a lot of anxiety\nabout my dislocation within Christian society, and it can lead to a lot of\ninternal tension, when I want to do what I _know_ is right,\nbut when another part of me believes that what I want to do is wrong because\nall the other Christians think so to.  Quite naturally, this tension has a\ndestructive effect on my relationship with God, and during all of this internal\nstrife, there's atheism sitting there like the promised land -- no rules, no\nresponsibilities, no need to live up to anyone's expectations but my own.\nComplete freedom.  Of course, it's all an illusion, but nevertheless, it's a\nvery appealing illusion, especially when the so-called \"people of God\" are\nbehaving like total twits.  I can easily understand why someone would go\nthat route, and would be hostile to ever coming back.\n\nIMHO, many of the former-Christians-turned-atheists-who-are-now-actively-\nhostile-to-Christianity are so because their experience with Christ and God\nwasn't a very peaceful one, but one of mind-control and \"shut-up-and-do-what-\nyou're-told-because-we-know-what's-best-for-you-because-it's-God's-will-and-\nyou're-to-young-to-know-what-God's-will-is-yet\" courtesy of some of Christ's\nmore overzealous followers.  \n\nA final reason why people become atheists is because Christians do not have a\nvery good reputation right now.  One of the things that attracted people to\nChristianity in the ancient days was the love that Christians obviously had\nfor one another and the world around them.  Unlike the rest of the world,\nChristian communities actively cared for their poor, and the Christian rich\ndid not trod on the backs of their poorer brothers, but bent down to help\nthem.  Christians were known for living exemplary lives, even if they were\nthought to be traitors to the state because they wouldn't sacrifice to the\nemporer.  Nowadays, courtesy of the media and some Christian leaders who lost\nChrist on their way to power, people see Christians as sexually-repressed\nhippocritical busibodies who want to remake society into a facist version of \ntheir own moral view.\n\nThere are a lot more reasons why people become atheists, but I don't have time\nto go into them right now.\n\n\n\nTom Ault\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 417 (FN-TP)"}, {"text": "From: bill@twg.bc.ca (Bill Irwin)\nSubject: Re: What WAS the immaculate conception\nReply-To: bill@twg.bc.ca (Bill Irwin)\nOrganization: The Westrheim Group (TWG)\nLines: 53\n\nragraca@vela.acs.oakland.edu (Randy A.

A generation\nbefore the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh,\ngateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather\nthan God's way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which would\nhave given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored their\ndecision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the\nland of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision-\nmakers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and\ndestined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the\ntime they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderers\nhad been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with a\nsigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they\nwere going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence.\nWhatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached\nbones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression of\nhopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nation\nat Kadesh and had God' s promise of one day entering the land. The\nforty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, those\nwho were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the\ninheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Moses\nprays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over.\nAll these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining\npeople through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden.\nHis was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but\nhe also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem was\nthat they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. \"Who is your\nGod?\" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. When\nAaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or young\nbull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bull\nwho had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt's gods as He led\nIsrael to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles grow\nthin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and water\ngushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the\nGod of Almightiness becomes \"ho-hum --What' s next on the miracle menu?\"\nAnd a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He might\nbe all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a right\nto do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these people\nhad known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men's lives had hung\non the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believed\nGod could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIM\nand, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, His\nacts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From the\nday of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God.\nAt Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. He\nhad seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. This\nrequest was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God's glorious\nPerson. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and\nlovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word \"lovingkindness\" is not to be\nunderstood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationship\narising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as the\nlove that says, \"I will never leave you nor forsake you.\" Lovingkindness is as\ntenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its\nheels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based on\nfeelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and,\ntherefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God's love is not an emotion\nthat wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our\nhighest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. God\ndoes not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings\nof love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with\nus! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Him\nto reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- not\nbecause of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committed\nto us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He will\nnot let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us--\nbut a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It is\nsaying to the recipient, \"For as long as we shall live, I am for you.\"  The God\nwho has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--in\nHis coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who is\nlovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will never\nleave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him as\nlove; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeing\nmiracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in the\nheart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power.\nMoses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had for\nthese people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, they\ncould not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born out\nof knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One who\ngives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is to\nmiss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  If\nman is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on\nknowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues from\nlove demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years of\nmeaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to\nknow the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and the\npossibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. The\nlanguage Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its\nmother's love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It is\nwaking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for,\nprotected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we were\nto ask, \"What has the baby done to deserve this?\" or, \"Have arrangements\nbeen made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?\" Our\nquestions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child was\nconceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love's excitement, a love\nthat has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents' love is\nunconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child\nor its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally,\nspontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after\nHis image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the\nLord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to\nearn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identity\nthrough the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents' love. It is a\nscientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if\nit survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has been\nheld and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the\nembrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the new\ngeneration will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in\nthe love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and\ngladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His\nlove. \"Satisfied.\" in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing\nbeing filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describe\nthe earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received\nenough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be\ndrenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is the\nlifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in our\ndeepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems\ndisappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling\nthat he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make\nsense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks this\nsatisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the\nemotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in\nreligious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding\nto the love of the living God. Only in knowing God's love will the rest of life\nmake sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again\nbecame the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find it\nfascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His\nlove. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one would\nthink he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by\nthe knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knew\nbetter. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won't\nfind it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to\nmanipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and\ngive us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyes\nand satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking God\nto make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses' prayer was partially\nanswered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which\nworked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in its\nfullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out the\nlove of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church,\nwe read of the Holy Spirit \"falling upon\" the believers. This is an ancient\nexpression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used in\nLuke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and \"falling on his\nneck and kissing him.\" The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest\nself and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your\nbeing. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes.\nMoses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization\nthat we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taught\nus to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in a\nstate of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance\nand love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive love\nwe cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the Holy\nSpirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness to\nthink on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jaded\nwith the doctrine of \"perform to be accepted.\" We begin to realize that He\nloves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challenge\neveryone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your\neyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may not\nfeel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed the\nother day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians kept\nbehind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rays\nwithout being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing\nthat we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according to\nMoses, \"joy and gladness all our days.\" Joy is the result of a life that is\nfunctioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might say\nthat joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. Man' s highest\nperformance is to rest in the love God has for him... the hum will be joy, and\nthe result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now\nhas in life. Stop wandering in the wilderness. Be satisfied with His love and,\nin joy, day by day, receive all His promised blessings.\n\n\n----- End Included Message -----\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 18 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: kempmp@phoenix.oulu.fi (Petri Pihko)\nSubject: Re: Christian Morality is\nOrganization: University of Oulu, Finland\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL9]\nLines: 107\n\nDan Schaertel,,, (dps@nasa.kodak.com) wrote:\n> In article 21627@ousrvr.oulu.fi, kempmp@phoenix.oulu.fi (Petri Pihko) writes:\n\n> |>I love god just as much as she loves me.

In fact, it is amusing to note in this\ncontext that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the\nopposite - one should not examine one's belief critically.\n\nI'll tell you something I left out of my 'testimony' I posted to this\ngroup two months ago. A day after I finally found out my faith is over,\nI decided to try just one more time. The same cycle of emotional\nresponses fired once again, but this time the delusion lasted only\na couple of hours. I told my friend in a phone that it really works,\nthank god, just to think about it again when I hung up. I had to admit\nthat I had lied, and fallen prey to the same illusion.\n\n> No one asks you to swallow everything, in fact Jesus warns against it.   But let\n> me ask you a question.

I learned what it means to use _reason_.\n\nAs a student of chemistry, I had to perform a qualitative analysis\nof a mixture of two organic compounds in the lab. I _hated_ experiments\nlike this - they are old-fashioned and increase the student's workload\nconsiderably. Besides, I had to do it twice, since I failed in my first\nattempt. However, I think I'll never forget the lesson: \n\nNo matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is X,\nit may still be Y. It is _very_ tempting to jump into conclusions, take\na leap of faith, assure oneself, ignore the data which is inconsistent. \nBut it can still be wrong. \n\nI found out that I was, after all, using exactly the same mechanism\nto believe in god - mental self-assurance, suspension of fear, \nfiltering of information. In other words, it was only me, no god\nplaying any part. \n\n> The life , death, and resurection of Christ is documented historical fact.\n\nOh? And I had better believe this? Dan, many UFO stories are much better\ndocumented than the resurrection of Jesus. The resurrection is documented\nquite haphazardly in the Bible - it seems the authors did not pay too\nmuch attention to which wild rumour to leave out. Besides, the ends of\nthe gospels probably contain later additions and insertions; for instance,\nthe end of Mark (16:9-20) is missing from many early texts, says my Bible.\n\nJesus may have lived and died, but he was probably misunderstood.\n\n> As much\n> as anything else you learn.  How do you choose what to believe and \n> what not to?\n\nThis is easy. I believe that the world exists independent of my mind,\nand that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what I\nobserve. Nothing else need to be taken on faith, I will go by the\nevidence. \n\nIt makes no difference whether I believe George Washington existed or not.\nI assume that he did, considering the vast amount of evidence presented.\n\n> There is no way to get into a sceptical heart.

It seems it is \nvery difficult to admit that someone who has really believed does not\ndo so anymore. But I can't go on lying to myself.\n\nBlind trust is dangerous, and I was just another blind led by the blind.\nBut if god really wants me, she'll know what to do. I'm willing.

M. Wilson\n   (London, 1923).\n\n2] Another work that might be useful is:\n   \"The Acts of the Apostles, a Critical Edition with Introduction and\n   Notes on Selected Passages\", Albert C. Clark (Oxford, 1933;\n   reprinted 1970).\n\n(This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the\ntext in Codex Bezae is the more authentic.  I don't know if it\nactually contains an english translation or not.)\n\n3] Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is:\n   \"The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in\n   Acts\", Eldon J Epp (Cambridge, 1966).\n\n4] The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the\nearly '80s.  (I can supply the reference if anyone's interested.)\n\n5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.  So if\nyou're interested in examining the differences in the long recension\nan excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in:\n   \"A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT\", Bruce Metzger (United Bible\n   Society, 1971).\n\nMetzger's book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of\nthe Greek NT.  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went\nbehind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in\nthe UBS3.  Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are\nincluded in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts).\n\nIn particular in the introduction to the section on Acts Metzger writes:\n   \"[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full\n   report (with an English translation) of the several additions and\n   other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ...\n   Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the\n   text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the\n   evidence that supports the divergent readings.\" (p 272).\n\n>I understand that one of the early codexes, Vaticanus and Siniaticus has\n>this version of Acts.  It would be interesting to know what the\n>differences are between the long and the short forms.\n\n6] Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have (including the\nones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter\n(or Alexandrian) version.  The longer version to which you refer is\nusually called the \"Western\" version and its main witness is the Codex\nBezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).\n\n7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark's edition\n(mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the\ntext edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains\n18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.\n\n8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations\nin the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The main\ndifference seems to \"expansion\" of detail in the Western text (or, if\nyou prefer \"contractions\" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seems\nto be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specific\ncases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.\n\n9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the\nmore authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anything\napproaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents\npurely the \"authentic\" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be\nexamined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the\nAlexandrian text is the \"better\" more often than not.\n\nN\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 506 (FN-TP)"}, {"text": "From: KEVXU@cunyvm.bitnet\nSubject: Re: Christianity and repeated lives\nOrganization: City University of New York\nLines: 36\n\nWhile this is essentially a discussion of reincarnation in the context of\nChristianity Gerry Palo has made some comparisons to Asian religious\nbeliefs on this topic which have simplified the Asian idea of karma\nto the point of misrepresentation.\n\nThere are significant differences in the idea of karma among Hindus,\nJains, Buddhists (and even among the various Buddhist traditions.)\n\nTo refer to karma as a system of reward for past deeds is totally\nincorrect in the Buddhist and Jain traditions.

Did you come by your beliefs through discussion, through\nindependent means, or by some combination of the two or other means?  \n\n\nAre you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational\nmeans (proofs of the non-existence of God, etc), or was it perhaps, at least \nin part, through other means (alienation from mainstream religion, etc)?  \n\n\nTo what extent do you feel you \"understand\" the universe through your beliefs?\nWhat phenomena of the universe and of human existence (anything from physical\nphenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs) do you \nfeel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs, and where are they lacking as \nan explanatory method?  \n\nWhat would it take for you to question, or change, your beliefs?  What would\nconvince you of the existence of God, what would convince you of the \nplausibility of God's existence, and so forth?  How dynamic are your beliefs\n-- are they constantly changing; have they stayed more or less the same for\nsome time?  \n\nAre you involved in a career or education in science?  To what extent do you\nthink science has influenced your beliefs?

Bailey\n\n     D.S. Bailey was perhaps the trailblazer of new assessments of the meaning\nof arsenokoitai.  He takes the term in I Cor 6:9 as denoting males who actively\nengage in homosexual acts, in contrast to malakoi (\"effeminate\"), those who\nengage passively in such acts.*4   However, he insists that Paul knew nothing\nof \"inversion as an inherited trait, or an inherent condition due to\npsychological or glandular causes, and consequently regards all homosexual\npractice as evidence of perversion\" (38).  Hence Bailey limits the term's\nreference in Paul's works to acts alone and laments modern translations of the\nterm as \"homosexuals.\"  Bailey wants to distinguish between \"the homosexual\n*condition* (which is morally neutral) and homosexual *practices*\" [italics in\nsource].  Paul is precise in his terminology and Moffatt's translation\n\"sodomites\" best represents Paul's meaning in Bailey's judgment (39).  Bailey\nclearly denies that the homosexual condition was known by biblical writers.\n\nJ. Boswell\n\n     The most influential study of arsenokoitai among contemporary authors is\nthat of John Boswell.*5    Whereas the usual translation*6  of this term gives\nit either explicitly or implicitly an active sense, Boswell gives it a passive\nsense.\n\n      In an extended discussion of the term (341-53), he cites \"linguistic\nevidence and common sense\" to support his conclusion that the word means \"male\nsexual agents, i.e. active male prostitutes.\"  His argument is that the arseno-\npart of the word is adjectival, not the object of the koitai which refers to\nbase sexual activity.  Hence the term, according to Boswell, designates a male\nsexual person or male prostitute.  He acknowledges, however, that most\ninterpret the composite term as active, meaning \"those who sleep with, make\ntheir bed with, men.\"  Boswell bases his interpretation on linguistics and the\nhistorical setting.  He argues that in some compounds, such as paidomathes\n(\"child learner\"), the paido- is the subject of manthano, and in others, such\nas paidoporos (\"through which a child passes\"), the paido- is neither subject\nnor object but simply a modifier without verbal significance.  His point is\nthat each compound must be individually analyzed for its meaning.  More\ndirectly, he maintains that compounds with the Attic form arreno- employ it\nobjectively while those with the Hellenistic arseno- use it as an adjective\n(343).  Yet he admits exceptions to this distinction regarding arreno-.\n\n     Boswell next appeals to the Latin of the time, namely drauci or exoleti. \nThese were male prostitutes having men or women as their objects.  The Greek\narsenokoitai is the equivalent of the Latin drauci;  the corresponding passive\nwould be parakoitai (\"one who lies beside\"), Boswell affirms.  He claims that\narsenokoitai was the \"most explicit word available to Paul for a male\nprostitute,\" since by Paul's time the Attic words pornos (\"fornicator\") and\nporneuon (\"one committing fornication\"), found also in the LXX, had been\nadopted \"to refer to men who resorted to female prostitutes or simply committed\nfornication.\"*7\n\n     In the absence of the term from pagan writers such as Herodotus, Plato,\nAristotle, and Plutarch, and from the Jewish writers Philo and Josephus,\nBoswell finds even more convincing evidence for his affirmation that\narsenokoitai \"did not connote 'homosexual' or even 'sodomite' in the time of\nPaul\" (346).*8   He also demonstrates its absence in Pseudo-Lucian, Sextus\nEmpiricus, and Libanius.  He subsequently finds it lacking in \"all discussions\nof homosexual relation\" (346)*9  among Christian sources in Greek, including\nthe Didache, Tatian, Justin Martyr, Eusebius,*10    Clement of Alexandria,\nGregory of Nyssa, and John Chrysostom.  Chrysostom is singled out for his\nomission as \"final proof\" that the word could not mean homosexuality.*11 \n\n     Boswell next appeals to the omission of the texts of I Cor and I Tim from\ndiscussions of homosexuality among Latin church fathers (348).*12   Cited are\nTertullian, Arnobius, Lactantius, and Augustine.  The last named uses\n\"circumlocutions.\"  Other Latin writers include Ausonius, Cyprian, and Minucius\nFelix.  The term is also lacking in state and in church legislation.  By the\nsixth century the term became confused and was applied to a variety of sexual\nactivities from child molesting to anal intercourse between a husband and wife\n(353).\n\n     Having surveyed the sources, Boswell concludes, \n\n   There is no reason to believe that either arsenokoitai or malakoi connoted\n   homosexuality in the time of Paul or for centuries thereafter, and every\nreason\n   to suppose that, whatever they came to mean, they were not determinative of\n   Christian opinion on the morality of homosexual acts (353).\n\nIt is clear throughout that Boswell defines arsenokoitai to refer to male\nprostitutes.  He even goes so far as to conclude that Paul would probably not\ndisapprove of \"gay inclination,\"  \"gay relationships,\"  \"enduring love between\npersons of the same gender,\" or \"same-sex eroticism\"  (112, 166-17).\n\n\n________________________________________________________\n4.

Here are a few\ncontradictions starting with the trial and continuing through the assension.\n\n>The death of Judas after the betrayal of Jesus\n\nActs 1:18: \"Now this man (Judas) purchased a field with the reward of \niniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his \nbowels gushed out.\"\n\nMatt. 27:5-7: \"And he (Judas) cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, \nand departed, and went and hanged himself.  And the chief priests...bought \nwith them the potter's field.\"\n\n>What was Jesus' prediction regarding Peter's denial?\n\nBefore the cock crow - Matthew 26:34\n\nBefore the cock crow twice - Mark 14:30\n\n>How many times did the cock crow?\n\nMAR 14:72  And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind  the \nword  that  Jesus  said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny\nme thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.\n\nMAT 26:74  Then began he to curse and to swear,  saying,  I  know not the man.\nAnd immediately the cock crew.\nMAT 26:75  And Peter remembered the word  of  Jesus,  which  said unto him,\nBefore the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept\nbitterly.\n\nLUK 22:60  And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest.  And immediately,\nwhile he yet spake, the cock crew.\nLUK 22:61  And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And  Peter remembered\nthe word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou\nshalt deny me thrice.\n\nJOH 13:38  Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? \nVerily,\n verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, still thou hast denied me\nthrice.\n\nJOH 18:27  Peter then denied  again:  and  immediately  the  cock crew.\n\n>destruction of cities (what said was jeremiah was zechariah)\n\n(This is interesting because Matthew quotes a prophesy that was never made! \nNot the only time he does this either...)\n\nMAT 27:9  Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy  the prophet, \nsaying,  And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was\nvalued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;\n\nzechariah 11:11-13\n(nothing in Jeremiah remotely like)\n\nWhat was the color of the robe placed on Jesus during his trial?\n\nscarlet - Matthew 27:28\n\npurple John 19:2\n\n>The time of the Crucifiction\n\nMark says the third hour, or 9 a.m., but John says the sixth hour (noon) was\nwhen the sentence was passed.\n\n>Inscription on the Cross\n\nMatthew  --  This is Jesus the king of the Jews\nMark\t --  The King of the Jews\nLuke\t --  This is the king of the Jews\nJohn\t --  Jesus of Nazareth the king of the Jews\n\n>What did they give him to drink?\n\nvinegar - Matthew 27:34\n\nwine with myrrh - Mark 15:23\n\n>Women at the Cross\n\nMatthew said many stood far off, including Mary Magdaline, Mary the mother of\nJames, and the mother of Zebedee's children.  Mark and Luke speak of many far\noff, and Mark includes Mary Magdeline and Mary the mother of James the less.\nJohn says that Jesus's mother stood at the cross, along with her sister and\nMary Magdalene.\n\n>Jesus' last words \n\nMatt.27:46,50: \"And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, \nsaying, \"Eli, eli, lama sabachthani?\" that is to say, \"My God, my God, why\nhast thou forsaken me?\"  ...Jesus, when he cried again with a loud voice,\nyielded u the ghost.\"\n\nLuke23:46: \"And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, \"Father, unto\n thy hands I commend my spirit:\" and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.\"\n\nJohn19:30: \"When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, \"It is \nfinished:\" and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.\"\n\n>Events of the crucifiction\n\nMatthew says that the veil of the temple was rent, that there was an\nearthquake, and that it was dark from the sixth to the ninth hour, that graves\nopened and bodies of the saints arose and went into Jeruselem, appearing to\nmany (beating Jesus to the resurection). Mark and Luke speak of darkness and\nthe veil of the temple being rent but mention no earthquake or risen saints. \nJohn is the only one who mentions Jesus's side being peirced.\n\n>Burial of Jesus\n\nMatthew says the Jews asked Pilate for a guard to prevent the body from being\nstolen by the disciples, and for the tomb to be sealed. All of this was\nsupposedly done, but the other gospels do not mention these precautions.\n\n>How long was Jesus in the tomb?\nDepends where you look; Matthew 12:40 gives Jesus prophesying that he will\nspend \"three days and three nights in the heart of the earth\", and Mark 10:34\nhas \"after three days (meta treis emeras) he will rise again\". As far as I can\nsee from a quick look, the prophecies have \"after three days\", but the\npost-resurrection narratives have \"on the third day\".\n\n>Time of the Resurection\n\nMatthew says Sunday at dawn, Mark says the sun was rising, and John says it\nwas dark.\n\n> Who was at the Empty Tomb?  Is it :\n\nMAT 28:1  In the end of the sabbath, as it began to  dawn  toward the first\nday of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.\n\nMAR 16:1  And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the  mother \nof  James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and\nanoint him.\n\nJOH 20:1  The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene  early, when  it \nwas  yet  dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the\nsepulchre.\n\n>Whom did they see at the tomb?\n\nMAT 28:2  And, behold, there was  a  great  earthquake:  for  the angel of the\nLord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door,\nand sat upon it.\nMAT 28:3  His countenance was like  lightning,  and  his  raiment white as\nsnow: MAT 28:4  And for fear of him the keepers did shake,  and  became as\ndead men. MAT 28:5  And the angel answered and said unto  the  women,  Fear\nnot ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.\n\nMAR 16:5  And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a  young  man sitting  on \nthe right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.\n\nLUK 24:4  And it came  to  pass,  as  they  were  much  perplexed thereabout,\nbehold, two men stood by them in shining garments:\n\nJOH 20:12  And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at  the head,  and \nthe  other  at  the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.\n\n>Belief that the disciples stole Jesus's body\n\nMatthew says the guard was paid to tell this story, but no other gospel makes\nthis claim.\n\n>Appearences of the risen Jesus\n\nMatthew says an angel at the tomb told the two Marys and that Jesus also told\nthem, to tell the disciples to meet him in Galilee.  The disciples then went\nto a mountain previously agreed opon, and met Jesus there.  This was his only\nappearance, except to the women at the tomb.  Matthew only devotes five verses\nto the visit with the disciples.\n\nMark says that Jesus walked with two of the disciples in the country, and that\nthey told the rest of the disciples, who refused to believe.  Later he\nappeared to the 11 disciples at mealtime.\n\nLuke says two followers went, the same day that Jesus rose from the dead, to\nEmmaus, a village eight miles from Jeruselem, and there Jesus jioned them but\nwas unrecognised.  While they ate a meal together that evening, they finally\nrecognised Jesus, whereopon he dissapeared.  Returning at once to Jeruselem,\nthey told the\ndisciples of their experience, and suddenly Jesus appeared among them,\nfrightening them, as they thought he was a spirit.  Jesus then ate some fish\nand honey and then preached to them.\n\nJohn says Jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he arrose, in\nJeruselem, where they were hiding.  He breathed the Holy Ghost opon them, but\nThomas was not present and refused to believe. Eight days later Jesus joined\nthe disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced Thomas.\tOnce\nmore Jesus made an\nappearance to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias but again was not\nrecognised.\n After telling them to cast their netson the other side of the boat, Jesus\nbecomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them.  They all eat\ntogether and converse.\n\nThe book of acts further adds to the confusion.  It says that Jesus showed\nhimself to the apostles for a period of 40 days after his resurection (thus\ncontradicting Matthew, Mark, Luke AND John) and spoke to them of things\npertaining to the kingdom of God: \"And when he had spoken these things, while\nthey beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud recieved him out of their sight. \nAnd while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, two men stood\nby them in white apparel: Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye\ngazing into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken from you into heaven,\nshall so comein like manneras ye have seen him go into heaven\" Acts 1:3-11\n\nPaul outdoes every other \"authority\" by saying that Jesus was seen by 500\npersons between the time of the resurection and the\nassension, although he does not say where.\tHe also claims that he himself \"as\none born out of due time\" also saw Jesus. 1 Cor 15:6-8.\n\n>The Ascension\n\nMatthew says nothing about it.\tMark casually says that Jesus was recieved into\nheaven after he was finished talking with the\ndisciples in Jeruselem.  Luke says Jesus led the desciples to Bethany and that\nwhile he blessed them, he was parted from them and carried up into heaven. \nJohn says nothing about it.  Acts\ncontradicts all of the above.  (See previous section)\n\n>When second coming?\n\nMAT 24:34  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all\nthese things be fulfilled.\n\nMAR 13:30  Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall  not pass, till\nall these things be done.\n\nLUK 21:32  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not  pass away, till\nall be fulfilled.\n\n1 thessalonians 4:15-18\n\n>How many apostles were in office between the resurection and ascention \n1 Corinthians 15:5 (12)\nMatthew 27:3-5 (minus one from 12)\nActs 1:9-26 (Mathias not elected until after resurrection)\nMAT 28:16  Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain\nwhere Jesus had appointed them.\n\n> ascend to heaven\n\t\"And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.\" (2 Kings 2:11)\n\n\t\"No man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven, \t...\nthe Son of Man.\" (John 3:13)\n\nAs you can see, there are a number of contradictions in the account of the\ntrial, crucifiction and resurection of Jesus.  If these are good witnesses,\nyou would think that they could get SOME of these important details right! \n(In fact, I cannot find very many points on where they AGREE.  You would think\nthat they could at least agree on some of the points they were supposedly\nobserving!) Because of the fact that there is so much contradiction and error,\nthe story of the resurection as presented cannot be taken as literal truth.\n(Due to the nature of the story, I doubt if it should be taken as ANY sort of\ntruth.)\n\n                   Alan\n\n", "true_class": 0, "title": "ID 610 (FP-FP)"}, {"text": "From: oser@fermi.wustl.edu (Scott Oser)\nSubject: Re: Studies on Book of Mormon\nOrganization: Washington University Astrophysics\nLines: 5\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: fermi.wustl.edu\n\nI think that _The_Transcedental_Temptation_, by Paul Kurtz, has a good\nsection on the origins of Mormonism you might want to look at.\n\n-Scott O.\n\n", "true_class": 0, "title": "ID 607 (FP-TN)"}, {"text": "From: tgk@cs.toronto.edu (Todd Kelley)\nSubject: Re: Faith and Dogma\nOrganization: Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto\nLines: 89\n\nmarshall@csugrad.cs.vt.edu (Kevin Marshall) <1r2eba$hsq@csugrad.cs.vt.edu>\nwrote:\n>I don't necessarily disagree with your assertion, but I disagree with\n>your reasoning.

That\nis what I mean by the word ``faith'': belief without justification, or\nbelief with arbitrary justification, or with emotional (irrational)\njustification.\n\nFor example, when someone says that God exists, that they don't know\nwhy they believe God exists, they can just feel it, that's faith.\n\nDogma is bad because it precludes positive change in belief based\non new information, or increased mental faculty.\n>\n>So Christians are totally irrational?  Irrational with respect to their\n>religion only?  What are you saying?  One's belief in a Christian God does\n>not make one totally irrational.  I think I know what you were getting at,\n>but I'd rather hear you expand on the subject.\n\nFaith and dogma are irrational.  The faith and dogma part of any religion\nare responsible for the irrationality of the individuals.  I claim that\nfaith and dogma are the quintessential part of any religion.  If that\nmakes (the much overused in this context) Buddism a philosophy rather\nthan a religion, I can live with that.  Science is not a religion,\nbecause there is no faith nor dogma.\n>\n>>A philosopher cannot be a Christian because a philosopher can change his mind,\n>>whereas a Christian cannot, due to the nature of faith and dogma present\n>>in any religion.\n>\n>Again, this statement is too general.  A Christian is perfectly capable of\n>being a philosopher, and absolutely capable of changing his/her mind.  Faith in\n>God is a belief, and all beliefs may change.  Would you assert that atheists\n>would make poor philosophers because they are predisposed to not believe in a\n>God which, of course, may show unfair bias when studying, say, religion?\n\nHave you noticed that philosophers tend to be atheists?  If a philosopher\nis not an atheist, s/he tends to be called a theologian.\n\nA Christian tends to consider Christianity sacred.  Christianity is\na special set of beliefs, sanctioned by God himself, and therefore,\nto conceive of changing those beliefs is to question the existence\nof That Being Who Makes No Mistakes.  Faith comes into play.  Dogma\ncomes into play.  ``The lord works in mysterious ways'' is an example\nof faith being used to reconcile evidence that the beliefs are flawed.\nSure, interpretations of what ``God said'' are changed to satisfy the\nneeds of society, but when God says something, that's it.  It was said,\nand that's that.  Since God said it, it is unflawed, even if the\ninterpretations are flawed.\n\nScience, (as would be practiced by atheists) in contrast, has a\nBUILT IN defence against faith and dogma.\nA scientist holds sacred the idea that beliefs should change to\nsuit whatever is the best information available at the time, AND,\n*AND*, ****AND***, a scientist understands that any current beliefs\nare deficient in some way.  The goal is to keep improving\nthe beliefs.  The goal is to keep changing the beliefs to reflect\nthe best information currently available.  That's the only rational\nthing to do.  That's good philosophy.\n\nCan you see the difference?  Science views beliefs as being flawed,\nand new information can be obtained to improve them.  (How many\nscientists would claim to have complete and perfect understanding\nof everything?  None---it would put them out of a job!)  Religion\nviews its beliefs as being perfect, and the interpretations of\nthose beliefs must be changed as new information is acquired which\nconflicts with them.\n>\n>Please explain how \"just because\" thinking kills people.  (And please\n>state more in your answer than \"Waco.\")\n\nIt's easier for someone to kill a person when s/he doesn't require\na good rational justification of the killing.  I don't consider\n``he's Jewish'', or ``he was born of Jewish parents'', or\n``this document says he's Jewish'' to be good rational justification.\n\n>By the way, I wasn't aware mass suicide\n>was a problem.

But if you can contrive\nto control the action in dreams or do an OOBE, it seems like a morality applies.\n\nNow, there seem to be 3 alternatives:\n\n1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.  In this case no morality\napplies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene', that is, not trying\nto think about anything evil, or indulgining in overly sexy or violent\nthoughts.\n\n2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane')\nEvidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in\ncommon by more than one person.  A\nmark of objective fact is that >1 people report the same objective experience.\nIn this case, the same interpersonal morality/ethics applies in dreams and\nOOBEs as does in waking life.\n\n3) Like (2), but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have a\nreal existence, a different moral/ethics apply there, and no (or maybe \ndifferent) moral laws apply there.\n\nSo... There it is.

And such were \n>some of you...\"  I Cor. 6:9-11.\n\nThe moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_\nin this.  I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of\nactivity that could be named by \"fornication\" or \"theft\" or \"coveting\" or\n\"reviling\" or \"drunkenness\" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may\nor may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very\nfact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at\nall \"clear\" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest\nin MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,\nwith all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated\nChristian discussion of ALL these areas.\n\nHomosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I\nknow) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and\nchild molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly\n\"harmless\" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --\nthat would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter\nyou cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that\nyou want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]\n\n\t\"'I am free to do anything,' you say.  Yes, but not everything\n\tis for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one\n\twill not let anything make free with me.\"  [1 Cor. 6:12]\n\nWhich is a restatement that we must have no other \"god\" before God.  A\ncommandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some\npeople are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.\nIt is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary\nargument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such\nbehavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers.\n\nI won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.\nFundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your\nassumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of\nlaws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of\nwhich Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine\nthem.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are \"moral\" and\nwhich ones are \"ritual.\"  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology\ncourse should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories\nin an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).\nAnd I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus\nfrom the \"ritual law\" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.\n\nI'm dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this\nmatter) about how \"repulsive\" and \"unnatural\" our acts are -- and what\ndo they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of\narbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating\ninsects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you\nsay that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part\nof the ritual law?\n\nFor those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\nbe \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\nit is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\ndetermine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the\nwhole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: \"No doubt I am free to do anything.\"\nBut Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,\nthe Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go\nthrough Leviticus and decide each \"command\" there on that basis, then\nyour own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this\ncontext, it is remarkably offensive to say:\n\n>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the\n>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.\n\nWell, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the\none that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously\n(though one can always find jokers) in \"defense\" of bestiality.  It is\nabsolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\nraise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\nadult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\nthan the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you\nare being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the\nworld.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not\nmine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in\nour culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing\nus as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means\nyou can think of to do so.\n\nJesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,\nthe central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to\nlove one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-\nians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get\nin return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.\n\nChristians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every\ncorner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same\nold verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never\neven read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with\nthe vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\nmanage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great\nemotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even\ntaking the trouble to find out what it is.\n\nSuch behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.\nWHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to\ncondemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN\nto BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?\nGod forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or\ncondemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in\ninsisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are\nSO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.\n\nWhy, for God's sake?\n\n\t\"For God did not send the Son into the world\n\tto condemn the world,\n\tbut that the world might be saved through him.\n\tWhoever believes in him is not condemned,\n\tbut whoever does not believe has already been condemned\n\tfor refusing to believe in the name of God's only Son.\n\tNow the judgment is this:\n\tthe light has come into the world,\n\tbut men have preferred darkness to light\n\tbecause their deeds were evil.\n\tFor everyone who practices wickedness\n\thates the light,\n\tand does not come near the light\n\tfor fear his deeds will be exposed.\n\tBut he who acts in truth\n\tcomes into the light,\n\tso that it may be sh0own\n\tthat his deeds are done in God.\"\tJohn 3:17-21\n\nFor long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from\nevil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and\nrejected.

A week ago, I managed to find time to consult\na Septuagint Concordance and a LXX text with apparatus at the library,\nand I can now usefully conclude my look at the Greek words for love as\nused in the Christian background of the Septuagintal translation of the\nJewish scriptures.\n\nThe principal result is that there is a cluster of uses of the verbal\nnoun from _erao:_, _eraste:s_ meaning \"lover.\"  This cluster occurs just\nwhere one might most expect it, in the propethic image (and accusation)\nof Israel as faithless spouse to YHWH.  The verses in question are Hosea\n2:5,7 & 10; Jeremiah 4:30, 22:20 & 22; Lamentations 1:19; and Ezekiel\n16:33, 36 &37 and 23:5, 9 & 22.\n\n\t[ Hosea seems to have originated this usage, which Jeremiah and\n\t  Ezekiel picked up;  Lamentations is dependent on, though not\n\t  likely written by, Jeremiah. ]\n\nThe \"erotic\" meaning (in its allegorical use, not at all literally) is\nevident.  So too in English, unless you complement it with a phrase like\n\"of the arts\" the word \"lover\" is going to have an overtone of sexual\nrelationship.  There is no surprise here, but it is worthwhile to see\nthat standard Greek usage *does* show up in the translations from the\nHebrew! :-)\n\nMore interestingly, and some confirmation of my guess that later Koine\nusage avoided the verb _erao:_ because of its homonymy to _ero:_ (say),\n_eromai_ (ask), there is an error in Codex Vaticanus (normally, a very\nvaluable witness) where a form of _erao:_ is used in a completely absurd\ncontext -- 2 Samuel 20:18, where the  meaning *must* be \"say.\"\n\nIn addition to the above (and the uses I have already mentioned in Proverbs),\nEsther 2:17 uses the verb in its most natural application, \n\n\tkai e:rasthe\" ho basileus Esthe:r  --  and the King loved Esther\n\nand, rather more interestingly, 1 Samuel 19:2 supplies a modest degree of\nsupport to the gay appraisal of the relationship of David and Jonathan:\n\n\tkai Io:nathan huios Saoul e:[i]reito ton Dauid sphodra\n\t-- and Jonathan, Saul's son, loved David intensely\n\n\t[ I'm using the bracketed [i] for io:ta subscript, which I\n\t  don't yet have a reasonable ASCII convention for. ]\n\n(The relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about\nthe \"historical\" facts, but just that a quasi-official translation of\nthe Hebrew text in the Hellenistic period makes no bones about using the\n\"erotic\" verb in this context.

READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tSince all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it\nis imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can\nquote them.

Money will be\nuseless.  \"And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and \nslave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that\nno one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, \nor the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding\ncalculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number\nis 666\" - Revelation 13:16-18.  \n\tThe Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of \nhumanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed\nin the past, such as the Holocaust.\n[or maybe the crusades? -M]\nYou cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's\nrule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) \"...I saw\nunder the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and\nfor the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of \nthem: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, \nuntil both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be\nkilled as they were, was completed.\" Revelation 6:9, 11.\n\tHis targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image\nor take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ \"...And I saw the souls of \nthose who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of \nGod, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark\non their foreheads or on the hands.\" - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every\nform of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor\nwill he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, \ntorturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take\nthe mark.  \n\tIf you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,\nyou will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.\n[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]\nYou cannot be redeemed.

SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL\n\n\tAlthough you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist's government\nuntil the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is \nimportant for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are\nextremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.\n\tThe first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or\nmountainous area, for the Antichrist's control will come last to the least\npopulated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay \nattuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.\n[\"As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep\ninto our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school\nclosings\" --M] \nStore water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without\nthe mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste\nfrom nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.\n[Get a good water filter. --M]\nBring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,\nbatteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to \nsurvive and live off the land as the pioneers did.\n\nVIII. TRUST NO ONE\n\t\n\tThere will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist's\ngovernment.  Be on the lookout.\n[Perot supporters take note --M]\n\nIX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST\n\n\tIt is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,\nfor he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will\nbring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel \n11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a\nhalf years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be \nphysically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and \npersonality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic\nexpert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which\nhe will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural \npower that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will\nbe deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.\n[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]\n\tThe antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who\nwill make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  \nAll who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and\na half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.\n\nX. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!\n\n\tThe seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of\nChrist.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you \nwill be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  \n\tStart reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of \nyour sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take\nthe mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or\nremain saved, but this time you will have to be \"faithful unto death.\"\n\n\tMay God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!\n\n******************************************************************************\nMike Cluff\t\t\t\t*  \"Christianity is Stupid.\nv22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms\t*   Give up.\" -Negativland\nUB Language Perception Laboratory\t*  \n******************************************************************************\n\n\n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\ \n\nBob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM \n\nThey said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,\nand sank Manhattan out at sea.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n", "true_class": 0, "title": "ID 94 (TN-FP)"}, {"text": "From: darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au (Fred Rice)\nSubject: Re: Genocide is Caused by Atheism\nOrganization: Monash University, Melb., Australia.\nLines: 19\n\nIn <1993Apr19.140316.14872@cs.nott.ac.uk> eczcaw@mips.nott.ac.uk (A.Wainwright) writes:\n\n>In article <1993Apr19.112706.26911@monu6.cc.monash.edu.au>, darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au (Fred Rice) writes:\n\n>|> (Great respect or love for a particular person does not equal a form of\n>|> \"theism\".)\n>|> \n>|>  Fred Rice\n>|>  darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au   \n\n>Hmm.

I don't know if it\nactually contains an english translation or not.)\n\n3] Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is:\n   \"The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in\n   Acts\", Eldon J Epp (Cambridge, 1966).\n\n4] The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the\nearly '80s.  (I can supply the reference if anyone's interested.)\n\n5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.  So if\nyou're interested in examining the differences in the long recension\nan excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in:\n   \"A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT\", Bruce Metzger (United Bible\n   Society, 1971).\n\nMetzger's book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of\nthe Greek NT.  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went\nbehind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in\nthe UBS3.  Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are\nincluded in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts).\n\nIn particular in the introduction to the section on Acts Metzger writes:\n   \"[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full\n   report (with an English translation) of the several additions and\n   other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ...\n   Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the\n   text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the\n   evidence that supports the divergent readings.\" (p 272).\n\n>I understand that one of the early codexes, Vaticanus and Siniaticus has\n>this version of Acts.

The longer version to which you refer is\nusually called the \"Western\" version and its main witness is the Codex\nBezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).\n\n7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark's edition\n(mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the\ntext edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains\n18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.\n\n8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations\nin the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The main\ndifference seems to \"expansion\" of detail in the Western text (or, if\nyou prefer \"contractions\" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seems\nto be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specific\ncases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.\n\n9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the\nmore authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anything\napproaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents\npurely the \"authentic\" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be\nexamined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the\nAlexandrian text is the \"better\" more often than not.\n\nN\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 145 (FN-TP)"}, {"text": "From: JEK@cu.nih.gov\nSubject: Goedel's ontological proof\nLines: 22\n\nFred Gilham asks (May 11) whether it is true that Kurt Goedel wrote\na version of the ontological argument for the existence of God.\n\nYes, he did.

And the stongest example in Jesus preaching is in the parable of \nLazarus and Dives, which is a parable!

The teacher of the class is what I consider to be\nclosed-minded and bigotted on the subject of what the definition of\nChristianity is.  His definition is tied directly to that of the\nTrinity and the Catholic church's definition of it and belief in\nJesus Christ is not sufficient to call one's self a Christian.\n\nWhile his saying it doesn't make it so,  I nevertheless feel insulted\n(or am I just neurotic? :^) ). I would like to be able to respond to\nhim with some sense of literacy while maintaining an amiable\nstudent-teacher relationship.\n\nSo, is there common definition of what Christianity is?  As the\nprevious discussion of the Trinity did not lend itself to an exchange\nof flames, I am hopeful that this will also not produce major\nflames.\n\nRegards,\n--\nLarry Autry\nSilicon Graphics, St. Louis\nautry@sgi.com \n\n\n\n[Often we get into discussions about who is Christian.  Unfortunately\nthere are a number of possible definitions.  Starting from the \nbroadest, commonly used definitions are:\n\n  a historical definition\n  people who accept Christ as Lord and savior\n  a broad doctrinal definition\n  narrow doctrinal definitions\n\n1) By a historical definition I mean the sort of definition a secular\nhistorian would likely use.  This would include any group that\ndeveloped out of the Christian church, and continues within the same\nbroad culture.  E.g. some Unitarians would fail just about any\ndoctrinal test you could come up with.  Yet it's clear that that group\ndeveloped from Christianity, and people from very different\nbackgrounds (e.g. Hindus) would likely see them as part of\nChristianity.  This is not a definition most Christians like, but it's\nrelevant in some political and ethnic contexts.\n\n2) Accepting Christ as Lord and savior is a test used by many\nChristian groups for membership, e.g. the Southern Baptists and\nPresbyterian Church (USA).  I would qualify it by saying that what\nmost people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to Christ, so that\nsomeone who accepted Christ as one of many gods would not fit.  It's\nan attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not based\non technical doctrine.  By this definition, groups such as Arians\nwould be viewed as heretical Christians, but still Christians.  In the\nmodern context this would include Mormons, JW's, and \"oneness\nPentecostals\".  They would be viewed as heretical Christians, but\nstill Christian.  In practice I believe just about everyone who falls\ninto this category would accept the Apostle's Creed.\n\n3) The next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition,\nwhich includes all of the major strands of Christianity, but excludes\ngroups that are felt to be outside \"historic Christianity.\"  This is\nof course a slippery enterprise, since Catholics could argue that\nProtestants are outside historic Christianity, etc.  But I think the\nmost commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the\nNicene Creed and the Formula of Chalcedon.  The attempt is to\ncharacterize doctrines that all major strands of Christianity agree\nare key.  Obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement.  A\nMormon will regard the LDS church as a major strand, and thus will not\nwant to include anything that contradicts their beliefs.  But I think\nthis definition would have fairly broad acceptance.\n\n4) Finally, some people use definitions that I would say are limited\nto a specific Christian tradition.  E.g. some evangelicals only\nconsider someone Christian if he has had an evangelical-style\nconversion experience, and some I've even heard of groups that limit\nit to their specific church.\n\nI think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used.\nA lot is going to depend upon the purpose you're using it for.  If\nyou're using it descriptively, e.g. in history or anthropology, you'll\nprobably use definition 1 or 2.  If you're using it normatively, i.e.\nto say what you believe the Christian message is, you'll probably use\na definition like 3 or even 4.\n\n--clh]\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 8 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: pww@spacsun.rice.edu (Peter Walker)\nSubject: Re: The Universe and Black Holes, was Re: 2000 years.....\nOrganization: I didn't do it, nobody saw me, you can't prove a thing.\nLines: 24\n\nIn article <1993Apr20.154658@IASTATE.EDU>, kv07@IASTATE.EDU (Warren\nVonroeschlaub) wrote:\n> \n>   Let's say that we drop a marble into the black hole.

Hislop did not.  His conclusions\ndo not tickle the ears, that much is self evident.  But to assert that his\nconclusions are \"spurious\" is without merit.  He gave references to all his\nconclusions and as I have stated, for the last 25 years I have used his\nconclusions in debates at RC seminaries and brotherhoods, not to mention the\nindividual priests and bishops that I have talked to one on one.  No counter to\nHislops scholarship was made.  The only rebuttals were against his conclusions\nbecause they do totally undermined the claims of the RCC. He was showing that\nthe intitution of the RCC was based on the mysteries (which others have shown\neven to this day in various articles and topics).  THe tongues movement in\nCorinth was a direct result of the mysteries entering into the church.  If it\nwas so in Corinth, why could they not have an influence in Rome, the city of\nseven hills?\n\nAlso, you do not have to listen to his conclusions, you can draw your own\nconclusions by looking at the customs, artifacts, the cerimonial dress, the\ndocrine of purgatory, etc from the vantage of the mysteries.

Does it have pagan history behind it, and if so,\nwhy did the RCC chose regardless?\n\nAny lay person of middle eastern religion can answer these questions.

Dr. James DeYoung; #3]\n\nR. Scroggs\n\n     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and\nsuggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a\n\"Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic\nterminology.\"  The term is derived from Lev 18\"22 & 20:13 where the LXX\njuxtaposes the two words arsenos (\"male\") and koiten (\"bed\"), and represents\nthe Hebrew miskab zabar (\"lying with a male\").   Yet he believes that Paul did\nnot originate the term, but borrowed it from \"circles of Hellenistic Jews\nacquainted with rabbinic discussions\" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid\n\"contact with the usual Greek terminology\" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs\nobserves, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions\nof pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to\nnative-speaking Greeks (108).\n\n     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the\nobject of the second part, thus differing from Boswell's \"learned discussion\"\n(107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of \"one who lies with a\nmale\" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9),\nwhich Scroggs interprets as \"the effeminate call-boy,\" arsenokoitai is the\nactive partner \"who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress' or who hires him on\noccasion to satisfy his sexual desires\" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not\nrefer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic\nmodel of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he\naffirms (109).\n     This is Scrogg's interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The\ncombination of pornoi (\"fornicators\"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai (\"slave\ndealers\") refers to \"male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave\ndealers [who procure them]\" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of\npederasty \"which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual\npurposes, and the use of these boys by adult males\" (121).  Even \"serious\nminded pagan authors\" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these\ninstances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently\ngeneral condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. \nConsequently Paul \"Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind\" (122).\nWe cannot know what Paul would have said about the \"contemporary model of\nadult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships\" (122).\n\n     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical\nconcerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of\nvices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and\nfunction of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any\nrelationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually\nnonexistent.  He concludes that Paul \"does not care about any specific item in\nthe lists\" (104). \n\n     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary\nphenomenon of a \"catalogue of vices,\"  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are\n\"irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today\" (129).  The \"model\nin today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model\nattacked by the NT\" that \"Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not\nrelevant to today's debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational\ndiscussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify\nrefusal of ordination. . . \" (127).\n\n      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI\n\nD. Wright\n\n     In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have\ncome under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell's\nview is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out\nseveral shortcomings of Boswell's treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults\nBoswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev\n18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the \"Apostolic\nConstitutions,\"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). \nBoswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term\nderives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This\nis significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell's\nclaim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the\ngender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean \"a male who sleeps with\na male,\" making arseno- the object.\n\n     Wright also faults Boswell's claims regarding linguistic features of the\nterm, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that\ncompounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it\nas an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely\none of dialectical diversity: \"No semantic import attaches to the difference\nbetween the two forms\" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which\nthe second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its\nobject and where \"the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its\ngender\" (132). \n\n     It is with Boswell's treatment of the early church fathers that Wright\ntakes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. \nFor example, Aristides' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis,\nandrobaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male\nhomosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell's discussion.  Boswell fails to cite\nHippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the\nSyriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to\nthe Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34). \n\n     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in\nparallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the\ndominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this\nparallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia (\"adultery\"), porneia\n(\"fornication\"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris\n(136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the\nTen Commandments as \"You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis (\"you shall not commit\nadultery\"), ou paidophthoreseis (\"you shall not practice homosexuality with\nboys\"), you shall not steal. . .\" (150 n. 43).\n\n     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein (\"commit homosexuality\") exists in the\nSibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was\ncoined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by\nOr.Sib., book 2 (137-38).\n\n     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew\nupon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John\nthe Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of\nhomosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.\n\n     Wright next replies to Boswell's contention that the term would not be\nabsent \"from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted\n(140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to\nthe first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used\ndozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g.\nDidache) show no acquaintance with Paul's letters or deliberately avoid citing\nScripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). \n\n     Boswell's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright's attention\n(141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom,\nomitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a\nlong uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom\n1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom's infrequent use of the term.  Wright\nobserves that Boswell has \"signally failed to demonstrate any us of\narsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual\nactivity\" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature\nand the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly\nspecified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world. \n\n     Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim\nand I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning\n\"homosexual\" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of\nthe word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell's limited\nconclusion based on them.\n\n     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the\ncatalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed\nin late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of\nhomosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the\npart of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into\nbeing under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke \"generally of\nmale activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual\nengagement with paides\" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were\ninterchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).\n\n     In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning\nhomosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and\nothers who limit the term to \"active male prostitutes\" or pederasty are without\nsignificant support from linguistic and historical studies.  \n\n[Next: the questioning of Wrights position by William Peterson.  After that, we\nget into the \"good\" stuff of historical & linguistic studies.  THis will\ninclude \"Symposium\" by Plato.  If there is any doubt as to the modern\nunderstanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time of\nPaul, this will certainly clear things up.  Also we will review Paul's use of\nLev18-20 in the NT and how, as for him, 1) the Law was fulfilled, but not done\naway with, 2) Lev 18-20 was the universal and the following chapters the\ngeneral.  Those who put forth that the OT no longer holds true today in our\nculture, should stick around for this one.]\n___________________________\n13 R. Scroggs, THe New Testament and Homosexuality (Phil: 1983) 86, 107-8. \nIndependently we came to the same conclusion.  Apparently the connection is\nmade in E.A. Sophocles, Greek Lexicon of the Roman & Byzantine Periods (from\n146BC to AD 1100).\n14   See discussion, 101-4.  He says the same thing about Paul's language in\nRom 1:26-27 (128).  But this is doubtful.  See the more cautious words of P.\nZaas, \"I Cor 6.9ff: Was Homosexuality Condoned in the Corinthian Church? SBLASP\n17 (1979):205-12.  He observes that the words moixai, malakoi, and arsenokoitai\nwere part of Jewish anti-Gentile polemic.  Yet Paul's wors at the end of the\nvice list, \"and such were some of you,\" indicate that \"Paul is addressing real\nor potential abuses of his ethical message, not citing primitive tradition by\nrote\" (210).  Wright disputes Zaas' attempt to associate the term with idolatry\n(147).\n15  On Boswell's treatment of Rom 1:26-7, the article by R.B. Hays, \"Relations\nNatural and Unnatural\"  A Response to John Boswell's Exegesis of Romans 1,\" JRE\n14/1 (Spring 1986): 184-215, is an excellent critique.\n16  D.F. Wright, \"Homosexuals or Prostitutes?  The Meaning of ARSENOKOITAI (I\nCor 6:9, I Tim 1:10), VC 38 (1984):125-53.\n17  In an unpublished paper, Henry Mendell, \"ARSENOKOITAI: Boswell on Paul,\"\neffectively refutres Boswell's claims regarding the philology of arsenokoitai. \nHe finds the meaning to be general, \"a male who has sex with a male\" (4-11).  \n18  Wright's endnotes (148-49) list additional sources in the church fathers.\n19   We also have noticed the same tendency by Boswell to fail to cite all the\nreferences to Sodom and sodomy in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha.  See  J.B.\nDeYoung, \"A Critique of Prohomosexual Interpretations of the OT Apocrypha and\nPseudepigrapha,\" BSac 146/588 (1990):437-53.\n20   In light of the claim made by Boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitai\npoints to a meaning lacking homosexual significance, Wright asks pertinently\n\"why neither Philo nor Josephus use  paidofthoria, nor Josephus paiderastia,\nand why . . Clement did not use the latter and Chrysostom the former?\"  (152 n.\n71)  In a more recent article, \"Homosexuality: The Relevance of the Bible,\" EvQ\n61 (1989):291-300, Wright reiterates these same points.  Paul shows a\n\"remarkable originality\" in extending the OT ethic to the church (300).\n\n \n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 12 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: kadie@cs.uiuc.edu (Carl M Kadie)\nSubject: [UPI] \"Mother files complaint over Boy Scouts\"\nKeywords: children, special interest, gambling, human interest, \tchildren's education, education\nOrganization: University of Illinois, Dept. of Comp.

Though I don't\n>mean to imply that all atheists are angry or hostile,\n>it does seem to be one motivation for giving up\n>faith.  Thus, some atheism might result from \n>broken-ness.\n\nI'd like to field this one, if I may.  Although I am a believer in and follower\nof Christ, my experiences with religion haven't been all that positive.  In\nfact, there was one point in my life when, for about three days, I simply\n_couldn't_ believe in the existence of God.  Anyway, when I look back upon the\ntroubles I've had, they seem to fall into two categories -- impulses to\nunbelief that resulted from logical contradictions, and impulses to unbelief\nthat resulted from frustration with God.\n\nThe first category doesn't occur to me much anymore, as I have worked through\nmost of the arguments for the non-existence of God.  But way back when, these\nwould cause me some problems, and I would have to struggle with my faith to\ncontinue to believe.  I can see where others less stubborn than I (and I do\nmean stubborn.  Stubborness has often been the only thing standing between\nme an atheism from time to time) would fail.\n\nThe second category arises out of some long-term personal difficulties and\nthe struggle to live my life as God would have me live it WITHOUT living my \nlife as others would tell me how God would have me live it.  A good example of\nthis is my struggle with the more radical Christians I meet.  I am not, nor\nhave I ever been, \"on fire for Chirst,\" and I don't think I ever want to be.\nNevertheless, I am not \"lukewarm\" about my faith, so I don't really\nfit in with the mainstream either.  Quite naturally, I feel a lot of anxiety\nabout my dislocation within Christian society, and it can lead to a lot of\ninternal tension, when I want to do what I _know_ is right,\nbut when another part of me believes that what I want to do is wrong because\nall the other Christians think so to.  Quite naturally, this tension has a\ndestructive effect on my relationship with God, and during all of this internal\nstrife, there's atheism sitting there like the promised land -- no rules, no\nresponsibilities, no need to live up to anyone's expectations but my own.\nComplete freedom.  Of course, it's all an illusion, but nevertheless, it's a\nvery appealing illusion, especially when the so-called \"people of God\" are\nbehaving like total twits.  I can easily understand why someone would go\nthat route, and would be hostile to ever coming back.\n\nIMHO, many of the former-Christians-turned-atheists-who-are-now-actively-\nhostile-to-Christianity are so because their experience with Christ and God\nwasn't a very peaceful one, but one of mind-control and \"shut-up-and-do-what-\nyou're-told-because-we-know-what's-best-for-you-because-it's-God's-will-and-\nyou're-to-young-to-know-what-God's-will-is-yet\" courtesy of some of Christ's\nmore overzealous followers.  \n\nA final reason why people become atheists is because Christians do not have a\nvery good reputation right now.  One of the things that attracted people to\nChristianity in the ancient days was the love that Christians obviously had\nfor one another and the world around them.  Unlike the rest of the world,\nChristian communities actively cared for their poor, and the Christian rich\ndid not trod on the backs of their poorer brothers, but bent down to help\nthem.  Christians were known for living exemplary lives, even if they were\nthought to be traitors to the state because they wouldn't sacrifice to the\nemporer.  Nowadays, courtesy of the media and some Christian leaders who lost\nChrist on their way to power, people see Christians as sexually-repressed\nhippocritical busibodies who want to remake society into a facist version of \ntheir own moral view.\n\nThere are a lot more reasons why people become atheists, but I don't have time\nto go into them right now.\n\n\n\nTom Ault\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 417 (FN-TP)"}, {"text": "From: shellgate!llo@uu4.psi.com (Larry L.

M. Wilson\n   (London, 1923).\n\n2] Another work that might be useful is:\n   \"The Acts of the Apostles, a Critical Edition with Introduction and\n   Notes on Selected Passages\", Albert C. Clark (Oxford, 1933;\n   reprinted 1970).\n\n(This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the\ntext in Codex Bezae is the more authentic.  I don't know if it\nactually contains an english translation or not.)\n\n3] Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is:\n   \"The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in\n   Acts\", Eldon J Epp (Cambridge, 1966).\n\n4] The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the\nearly '80s.  (I can supply the reference if anyone's interested.)\n\n5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.  So if\nyou're interested in examining the differences in the long recension\nan excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in:\n   \"A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT\", Bruce Metzger (United Bible\n   Society, 1971).\n\nMetzger's book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of\nthe Greek NT.  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went\nbehind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in\nthe UBS3.  Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are\nincluded in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts).\n\nIn particular in the introduction to the section on Acts Metzger writes:\n   \"[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full\n   report (with an English translation) of the several additions and\n   other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ...\n   Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the\n   text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the\n   evidence that supports the divergent readings.\" (p 272).\n\n>I understand that one of the early codexes, Vaticanus and Siniaticus has\n>this version of Acts.  It would be interesting to know what the\n>differences are between the long and the short forms.\n\n6] Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have (including the\nones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter\n(or Alexandrian) version.  The longer version to which you refer is\nusually called the \"Western\" version and its main witness is the Codex\nBezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).\n\n7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark's edition\n(mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the\ntext edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains\n18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.\n\n8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations\nin the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The main\ndifference seems to \"expansion\" of detail in the Western text (or, if\nyou prefer \"contractions\" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seems\nto be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specific\ncases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.\n\n9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the\nmore authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anything\napproaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents\npurely the \"authentic\" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be\nexamined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the\nAlexandrian text is the \"better\" more often than not.\n\nN\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 506 (FN-TP)"}, {"text": "From: af664@yfn.ysu.edu (Frank DeCenso, Jr.)\nSubject: _Christianity In Crisis_ by Hank Hanegraaff\nOrganization: Youngstown State/Youngstown Free-Net\nLines: 6\n\nHas anyone read this important book?

Bailey\n\n     D.S. Bailey was perhaps the trailblazer of new assessments of the meaning\nof arsenokoitai.  He takes the term in I Cor 6:9 as denoting males who actively\nengage in homosexual acts, in contrast to malakoi (\"effeminate\"), those who\nengage passively in such acts.*4   However, he insists that Paul knew nothing\nof \"inversion as an inherited trait, or an inherent condition due to\npsychological or glandular causes, and consequently regards all homosexual\npractice as evidence of perversion\" (38).  Hence Bailey limits the term's\nreference in Paul's works to acts alone and laments modern translations of the\nterm as \"homosexuals.\"  Bailey wants to distinguish between \"the homosexual\n*condition* (which is morally neutral) and homosexual *practices*\" [italics in\nsource].  Paul is precise in his terminology and Moffatt's translation\n\"sodomites\" best represents Paul's meaning in Bailey's judgment (39).  Bailey\nclearly denies that the homosexual condition was known by biblical writers.\n\nJ. Boswell\n\n     The most influential study of arsenokoitai among contemporary authors is\nthat of John Boswell.*5    Whereas the usual translation*6  of this term gives\nit either explicitly or implicitly an active sense, Boswell gives it a passive\nsense.\n\n      In an extended discussion of the term (341-53), he cites \"linguistic\nevidence and common sense\" to support his conclusion that the word means \"male\nsexual agents, i.e. active male prostitutes.\"  His argument is that the arseno-\npart of the word is adjectival, not the object of the koitai which refers to\nbase sexual activity.  Hence the term, according to Boswell, designates a male\nsexual person or male prostitute.  He acknowledges, however, that most\ninterpret the composite term as active, meaning \"those who sleep with, make\ntheir bed with, men.\"  Boswell bases his interpretation on linguistics and the\nhistorical setting.  He argues that in some compounds, such as paidomathes\n(\"child learner\"), the paido- is the subject of manthano, and in others, such\nas paidoporos (\"through which a child passes\"), the paido- is neither subject\nnor object but simply a modifier without verbal significance.  His point is\nthat each compound must be individually analyzed for its meaning.  More\ndirectly, he maintains that compounds with the Attic form arreno- employ it\nobjectively while those with the Hellenistic arseno- use it as an adjective\n(343).  Yet he admits exceptions to this distinction regarding arreno-.\n\n     Boswell next appeals to the Latin of the time, namely drauci or exoleti. \nThese were male prostitutes having men or women as their objects.  The Greek\narsenokoitai is the equivalent of the Latin drauci;  the corresponding passive\nwould be parakoitai (\"one who lies beside\"), Boswell affirms.  He claims that\narsenokoitai was the \"most explicit word available to Paul for a male\nprostitute,\" since by Paul's time the Attic words pornos (\"fornicator\") and\nporneuon (\"one committing fornication\"), found also in the LXX, had been\nadopted \"to refer to men who resorted to female prostitutes or simply committed\nfornication.\"*7\n\n     In the absence of the term from pagan writers such as Herodotus, Plato,\nAristotle, and Plutarch, and from the Jewish writers Philo and Josephus,\nBoswell finds even more convincing evidence for his affirmation that\narsenokoitai \"did not connote 'homosexual' or even 'sodomite' in the time of\nPaul\" (346).*8   He also demonstrates its absence in Pseudo-Lucian, Sextus\nEmpiricus, and Libanius.  He subsequently finds it lacking in \"all discussions\nof homosexual relation\" (346)*9  among Christian sources in Greek, including\nthe Didache, Tatian, Justin Martyr, Eusebius,*10    Clement of Alexandria,\nGregory of Nyssa, and John Chrysostom.  Chrysostom is singled out for his\nomission as \"final proof\" that the word could not mean homosexuality.*11 \n\n     Boswell next appeals to the omission of the texts of I Cor and I Tim from\ndiscussions of homosexuality among Latin church fathers (348).*12   Cited are\nTertullian, Arnobius, Lactantius, and Augustine.  The last named uses\n\"circumlocutions.\"  Other Latin writers include Ausonius, Cyprian, and Minucius\nFelix.  The term is also lacking in state and in church legislation.  By the\nsixth century the term became confused and was applied to a variety of sexual\nactivities from child molesting to anal intercourse between a husband and wife\n(353).\n\n     Having surveyed the sources, Boswell concludes, \n\n   There is no reason to believe that either arsenokoitai or malakoi connoted\n   homosexuality in the time of Paul or for centuries thereafter, and every\nreason\n   to suppose that, whatever they came to mean, they were not determinative of\n   Christian opinion on the morality of homosexual acts (353).\n\nIt is clear throughout that Boswell defines arsenokoitai to refer to male\nprostitutes.  He even goes so far as to conclude that Paul would probably not\ndisapprove of \"gay inclination,\"  \"gay relationships,\"  \"enduring love between\npersons of the same gender,\" or \"same-sex eroticism\"  (112, 166-17).\n\n\n________________________________________________________\n4.

A generation\nbefore the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh,\ngateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather\nthan God's way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which would\nhave given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored their\ndecision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the\nland of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision-\nmakers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and\ndestined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the\ntime they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderers\nhad been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with a\nsigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they\nwere going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence.\nWhatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached\nbones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression of\nhopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nation\nat Kadesh and had God' s promise of one day entering the land. The\nforty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, those\nwho were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the\ninheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Moses\nprays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over.\nAll these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining\npeople through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden.\nHis was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but\nhe also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem was\nthat they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. \"Who is your\nGod?\" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. When\nAaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or young\nbull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bull\nwho had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt's gods as He led\nIsrael to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles grow\nthin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and water\ngushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the\nGod of Almightiness becomes \"ho-hum --What' s next on the miracle menu?\"\nAnd a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He might\nbe all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a right\nto do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these people\nhad known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men's lives had hung\non the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believed\nGod could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIM\nand, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, His\nacts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From the\nday of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God.\nAt Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. He\nhad seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. This\nrequest was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God's glorious\nPerson. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and\nlovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word \"lovingkindness\" is not to be\nunderstood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationship\narising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as the\nlove that says, \"I will never leave you nor forsake you.\" Lovingkindness is as\ntenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its\nheels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based on\nfeelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and,\ntherefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God's love is not an emotion\nthat wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our\nhighest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. God\ndoes not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings\nof love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with\nus! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Him\nto reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- not\nbecause of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committed\nto us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He will\nnot let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us--\nbut a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It is\nsaying to the recipient, \"For as long as we shall live, I am for you.\"  The God\nwho has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--in\nHis coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who is\nlovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will never\nleave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him as\nlove; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeing\nmiracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in the\nheart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power.\nMoses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had for\nthese people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, they\ncould not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born out\nof knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One who\ngives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is to\nmiss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  If\nman is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on\nknowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues from\nlove demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years of\nmeaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to\nknow the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and the\npossibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. The\nlanguage Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its\nmother's love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It is\nwaking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for,\nprotected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we were\nto ask, \"What has the baby done to deserve this?\" or, \"Have arrangements\nbeen made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?\" Our\nquestions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child was\nconceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love's excitement, a love\nthat has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents' love is\nunconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child\nor its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally,\nspontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after\nHis image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the\nLord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to\nearn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identity\nthrough the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents' love. It is a\nscientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if\nit survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has been\nheld and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the\nembrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the new\ngeneration will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in\nthe love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and\ngladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His\nlove. \"Satisfied.\" in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing\nbeing filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describe\nthe earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received\nenough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be\ndrenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is the\nlifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in our\ndeepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems\ndisappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling\nthat he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make\nsense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks this\nsatisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the\nemotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in\nreligious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding\nto the love of the living God. Only in knowing God's love will the rest of life\nmake sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again\nbecame the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find it\nfascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His\nlove. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one would\nthink he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by\nthe knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knew\nbetter. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won't\nfind it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to\nmanipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and\ngive us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyes\nand satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking God\nto make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses' prayer was partially\nanswered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which\nworked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in its\nfullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out the\nlove of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church,\nwe read of the Holy Spirit \"falling upon\" the believers. This is an ancient\nexpression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used in\nLuke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and \"falling on his\nneck and kissing him.\" The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest\nself and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your\nbeing. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes.\nMoses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization\nthat we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taught\nus to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in a\nstate of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance\nand love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive love\nwe cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the Holy\nSpirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness to\nthink on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jaded\nwith the doctrine of \"perform to be accepted.\" We begin to realize that He\nloves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challenge\neveryone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your\neyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may not\nfeel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed the\nother day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians kept\nbehind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rays\nwithout being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing\nthat we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according to\nMoses, \"joy and gladness all our days.\" Joy is the result of a life that is\nfunctioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might say\nthat joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. Man' s highest\nperformance is to rest in the love God has for him... the hum will be joy, and\nthe result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now\nhas in life. Stop wandering in the wilderness. Be satisfied with His love and,\nin joy, day by day, receive all His promised blessings.\n\n\n----- End Included Message -----\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 18 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: wilsonr@logica.co.uk\nSubject: Re: What it means to be human?

Karma is considered to\nbe a moral process in which intentions (either good or evil) shape\na person's predilections for future intention and action and\nproduce a person who is more prone to good than evil, or the opposite --\n\"reward\" has nothing to do with it.

A day after I finally found out my faith is over,\nI decided to try just one more time. The same cycle of emotional\nresponses fired once again, but this time the delusion lasted only\na couple of hours.

However, I think I'll never forget the lesson: \n\nNo matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is X,\nit may still be Y. It is _very_ tempting to jump into conclusions, take\na leap of faith, assure oneself, ignore the data which is inconsistent. \nBut it can still be wrong. \n\nI found out that I was, after all, using exactly the same mechanism\nto believe in god - mental self-assurance, suspension of fear, \nfiltering of information. In other words, it was only me, no god\nplaying any part. \n\n> The life , death, and resurection of Christ is documented historical fact.\n\nOh? And I had better believe this? Dan, many UFO stories are much better\ndocumented than the resurrection of Jesus. The resurrection is documented\nquite haphazardly in the Bible - it seems the authors did not pay too\nmuch attention to which wild rumour to leave out. Besides, the ends of\nthe gospels probably contain later additions and insertions; for instance,\nthe end of Mark (16:9-20) is missing from many early texts, says my Bible.\n\nJesus may have lived and died, but he was probably misunderstood.\n\n> As much\n> as anything else you learn.

I doubt this will have much bearing on the\n\tarticle as such, but thought I should point it out from the start.]\n\nThe hypothesis De Young is advancing is that Paul a) coined the word and\nb) his intended meaning for it was in reference to the Levitical law.  The\nquestions I wish to raise are\n\n\t1.)  how would one go about confirming the truth of this hypothesis?\nand\t2.)  what follows if one accepts (or stipulates, for the sake of the\n\t     discussion) that it is correct?\n\nNote that b) is independent of a); I consider b) far more plausible than a),\nwhich seems merely to be a counsel of despair over finding nothing in the\nliterature contemporary with Paul to clarify this word.  So far as I know,\nPaul does NOT in general invent words anywhere else in his letters.  Unless\nyou have an otherwise-established pattern of coinages, it is *not* sound\nmethodology to assume it -- particularly if he gives no hint in the immedi-\nate text to \"fix\" the coinage's meaning for his audience.\n\nAs yet, the extract presents no evidence at all.  What do we need to confirm\nor reject the hypothesis? (which, I should say at the outset, I find somewhat\nplausible; I certainly know of nothing which makes it an *impossible* way\nof construing this problem passage.)  I'm going to set aside for the moment\nthe question of whether Paul might have coined this usage, to look at the\nmore tractable question of what it means.  For this there are, in principle,\ntwo kinds of evidence that can be adduced, internal and external.  That is,\nwe can look at the text of Paul's letter for clarification or look outside\nthat to prior or contemporary writings that Paul might have relied on, or to\nderivative writings that have some claim of access to Paul's meaning.\n\nThe single WORST problem with this word in Corinthians is that there IS no\ninternal evidence for Paul's meaning.  He uses the word totally without an\nexplanation or hint as to his meaning, save that its inclusion in a list of\nnegatives implies that it has for him SOME negative meaning.\n\nWe are left, as the only \"internal\" clue, with the etymology or formation\nof the word -- which is indeed the reason that De Young (and others before\nhim) have associated it with the Leviticus prohibition of men VERBing with\nother men, where VERB is some standard euphemism for having sex (\"lie\" in\nLeviticus, \"bed\" in Greek).  One problem is that \"bedders\" (_-koitai_) is\nnot, as far as I know, USED that way in Greek.  THEREFORE, I offer one\nserious test which de Young's hypothesis *must* pass or be rejected:\n\n\to  find a body of Greek texts contemporary with Paul (or not much\n\t   prior to his day) such that the _X-koitai_ formation implies\n\t   \"men who have sex with X\"  [obviously, the \"best case\" is to\n\t   find such usages of _arsenokoitai_ itself.]\n\nsuch texts would be confirmation that the word *can* be read that way.\nIt is worth emphasizing that compound words are NOT in general under-\nstandable by projecting what the READER may imagine by the juxtaposition\nof the roots.  Existence of such parallels doesn't *prove* the hypothesis\ncorrect -- but it goes a long way towards making such a usage (whether or\nnot original with Paul in the specific case of X == _arse:n_) possible\nof comprehension by his readers.\n\nMy \"test\" moves in the direction of external evidence.  If Paul does NOT\nin his text explain his word (and he does not), then he has to expect his\nreaders to already know the word (which stands against its being a coinage)\nor to expect that it mimics word formations that they *do* know, such that\nthey can guess his meaning without too much floundering.\n\nExternal evidence, that is, texts other than Paul's own and lexicographic\nor social/historical considerations that might be adduced, then come into\nthe picture.  *If* there are other uses of the word, not dependent on Paul,\nwhich *have* sufficient internal (contextual) evidence -- or some gloss by\na contemporary scribe -- to show a derogatory reference to male homosexu-\nality, or similar _-koitai_ formations used in similar ways, *then* one\nhas grounds for\n\n\to  denying that Paul coined the word\nand\to  assuming that his readers might understand his meaning\n\nDo you see the problem?  If Paul coined the word, then he REQUIRES his\nreaders to share enough context with him to COMPREHEND his coinage and\nits intent -- in this case that they would (stipulating De Young's guess)\nunderstand him to be referring to the Levitical \"universal\" prohibition\nof male-male sex (this, mind you, in a context where Paul has emphasized\nat least to OTHER congregations (and so one assumes to the Corinthians --\nhow else to explain 1 Cor. 6:12, and the Corinthians having to be pulled\nback from overinterpreting their freedom?) the NON applicability of Torah\nlaw to his gentile converts!)\n\nAmong the considerations that make it implausible for Paul to have coined\nthe word, its first element is archaic -- _arse:n_ is an old Attic or\nIonic form of what in even classical (let alone koine) times would be\nassimilated as _arre:n_.  To me, this implies that we are even more than\nusually needful of external evidence to pin down meaning and usage.  What\nis Paul doing inventing a word in obsolete Attic formation?\n\nAnd if he *didn't* coin the word, but picked it up like the others in\nhis list as common terms of derogation, then his meaning will be -- for\nhis readers -- constrained by that common meaning (since he gives no\nother.)\n\nI cannot emphasize enough that Paul DOES NOT TELL US what he means by\nthis word.  We (and his original readers) are guessing.  They, at least,\nhad a contemporary context -- and maybe Paul had used this very word and\nexplained it in great detail to them in person.  But we have no trace of\nevidence of that, and to *suppose* it is mere fantasy.\n\nSo -- we are *desperately* in need of external evidence about this word.\nAnd it seems to be exceptionally meagre.  That is precisely the problem.\nI can think of several more or less equally plausible hypotheses about\nthe word:\n\n\ta)  it was a standard gutter term of abuse for (some or all, maybe\n\t    very specific, maybe very general) homosexual male activities\n\n\tb)  it was a term of abuse used by Jews about the awful homosexual\n\t    Greeks (which may or may not be consciously associated on their\n\t    part with the Leviticus passage)\n\n\tc)  Paul invented the term -- and again there may or may not be an\n\t    association with Leviticus in his doing so.  He may or may not\n\t    intend the word to have an explicit and universal application\n\t    with absolute and clear boundaries.  [Since none of his OTHER\n\t    words in that list have such character, this last seems to me\n\t    about the *least* plausible of the hypotheses I'm advancing.]\n\nOf these, I'd say off the top of my head that a) is most plausible -- but\nI still have reservations about that, too.\n\nIf the word NEVER appears before Paul, and in later uses has some evidence\nof depending on Paul, then one can opt for Paul's coining it.  If it does\nappear before him, he might *still* have coined it being unaware of prior\nuse (in which case, his coinage is inherently confusing!) but one should\nnormally demote c) on the basis of any earlier uses (especially if they\ncan be shown to have been at all common in the places Paul traveled.)  In\neither of the a) or b) cases, one has to take into account Paul's relation\nto the community of usage he picked the word up from -- and whether it be\nfrom the Greek or Jewish communities, Paul's relations are hardly straight-\nforward!\n\nThere is, so far as I have yet seen, little or no external evidence to aid\nus in selecting one of these (or some other) hypothesis.  Your guess is as\ngood as mine (or maybe worse or maybe better, depending on a lot of things).\nBut it remains -- so far -- guesswork.  And I don't know about you, but I\nfor one WILL NOT equate human guesswork with the will of God.  By all means\nbe convinced in your own conscience about what Paul is getting at -- as he\nsays elsewhere on what was in HIS day a major controversy of somewhat this\nsame character (Romans 14:22-23)\n\n\t\"Hold on to your own belief, as between yourself and God -- and\n\tconsider the man fortunate who can make his decision without going\n\tagainst his conscience.  But anybody who eats in a state of doubt\n\tis condemned, because he is not in good faith, and every act done\n\tin bad faith is a sin.\"\n\nFor my part, I cannot see any way to resolve Paul's meaning in the use of\n_arsenokoitai_ without directly applicable external evidence -- and by\nthe nature of such external evidence, it will never reach to certainty\nof constraining Paul's own intent.  Paul, like Humpty Dumpty (and me, and\nall the rest of us) *will* use words in ways that are personal choices --\nand sometimes leave his readers puzzled.  If that puzzlement leads you\nto God, it may be blessed -- if it should lead away (as some of Paul's\nwords HAVE led some people), then Paul's intense communicative effort to\ncontrive his meaning in our souls may have some regretable consequences.\nI have always found Paul to be a fantastically reliable guide -- if I\nread him \"in the large\", if I can see him lay out his position in detail\nand hammer it home time and time again.  I am much less certain about his\nmeaning in his many brief and cryptic passages (such as this one.)\n\nIn my usual discursive way, I have gone on at great length about the first\nof my intended meta-exegetical points -- what would be needed to confirm\nthat Paul a) coined or b) in any case meant the word to mean the same as\nthe Leviticus prohibition.  My second point is to *stipulate* this hypo-\nthesis, and follow up what it implies for both his initial readers and\nfor later Christians.

STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC\n\n\tYour natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to\npanic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get right\nwith God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your \nonly chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the \nTribulation.  \"But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be \nsaved.\" - Matthew 24:13\n\nII. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION\n\n\tThe Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of\nthe rapture until Christ's second coming.  Also know as \"the time of Jacob's\n(Israel's) trouble\" (Jere 30:7) and \"Daniel's Seventieth Week\" (Dan 9), this \nperiod will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.\n\nIII. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM\n\n\tSoon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community \n(the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will\nbe tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable \npossession during the Tribulation.\n\nIV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tSince all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it\nis imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can\nquote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, \nRevelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to\nunfold before you.  \n\nV. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tPray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray \nand pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual \nstrength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the\nsake of Christ.  \n\nVI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED\nONES DIE AS MARTYRS\n\n\tAfter the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he\nwill institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell,\nor eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be\nuseless.  \"And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and \nslave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that\nno one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, \nor the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding\ncalculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number\nis 666\" - Revelation 13:16-18.  \n\tThe Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of \nhumanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed\nin the past, such as the Holocaust.\n[or maybe the crusades? -M]\nYou cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's\nrule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) \"...I saw\nunder the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and\nfor the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of \nthem: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, \nuntil both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be\nkilled as they were, was completed.\" Revelation 6:9, 11.\n\tHis targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image\nor take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ \"...And I saw the souls of \nthose who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of \nGod, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark\non their foreheads or on the hands.\" - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every\nform of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor\nwill he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, \ntorturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take\nthe mark.  \n\tIf you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,\nyou will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.\n[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]\nYou cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and\ngain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake\nof Fire.  \"...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his \nmark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of\nthe wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His \nindignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the \npresence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.\" -Revelation \n14:9-10 \n\n[and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to\nthe first 5,000 at the stadium --M] \n\nVII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL\n\n\tAlthough you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist's government\nuntil the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is \nimportant for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are\nextremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.\n\tThe first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or\nmountainous area, for the Antichrist's control will come last to the least\npopulated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay \nattuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.\n[\"As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep\ninto our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school\nclosings\" --M] \nStore water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without\nthe mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste\nfrom nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.\n[Get a good water filter. --M]\nBring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,\nbatteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to \nsurvive and live off the land as the pioneers did.\n\nVIII. TRUST NO ONE\n\t\n\tThere will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist's\ngovernment.  Be on the lookout.\n[Perot supporters take note --M]\n\nIX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST\n\n\tIt is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,\nfor he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will\nbring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel \n11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a\nhalf years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be \nphysically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and \npersonality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic\nexpert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which\nhe will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural \npower that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will\nbe deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.\n[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]\n\tThe antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who\nwill make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  \nAll who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and\na half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.\n\nX. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!\n\n\tThe seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of\nChrist.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you \nwill be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  \n\tStart reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of \nyour sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take\nthe mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or\nremain saved, but this time you will have to be \"faithful unto death.\"\n\n\tMay God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!\n\n******************************************************************************\nMike Cluff\t\t\t\t*  \"Christianity is Stupid.\nv22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms\t*   Give up.\" -Negativland\nUB Language Perception Laboratory\t*  \n******************************************************************************\n\n\n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\ \n\nBob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM \n\nThey said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,\nand sank Manhattan out at sea.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n", "true_class": 0, "title": "ID 94 (FP-FP)"}, {"text": "From: cmtan@iss.nus.sg (Tan Chade Meng - dan)\nSubject: Christianity & Logic (was: Xtian Morality is)\nOrganization: Institute Of Systems Science, NUS\nX-Newsreader: Tin 1.1 PL4\nLines: 59\n\n\nIn article <4949@eastman.UUCP> dps@nasa.kodak.com writes:\n>Simple logic arguments are folly.

And such were \n>some of you...\"  I Cor. 6:9-11.\n\nThe moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_\nin this.  I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of\nactivity that could be named by \"fornication\" or \"theft\" or \"coveting\" or\n\"reviling\" or \"drunkenness\" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may\nor may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very\nfact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at\nall \"clear\" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest\nin MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,\nwith all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated\nChristian discussion of ALL these areas.\n\nHomosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I\nknow) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and\nchild molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly\n\"harmless\" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --\nthat would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter\nyou cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that\nyou want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]\n\n\t\"'I am free to do anything,' you say.  Yes, but not everything\n\tis for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one\n\twill not let anything make free with me.\"  [1 Cor. 6:12]\n\nWhich is a restatement that we must have no other \"god\" before God.  A\ncommandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some\npeople are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.\nIt is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary\nargument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such\nbehavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers.\n\nI won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.\nFundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your\nassumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of\nlaws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of\nwhich Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine\nthem.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are \"moral\" and\nwhich ones are \"ritual.\"  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology\ncourse should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories\nin an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).\nAnd I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus\nfrom the \"ritual law\" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.\n\nI'm dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this\nmatter) about how \"repulsive\" and \"unnatural\" our acts are -- and what\ndo they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of\narbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating\ninsects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you\nsay that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part\nof the ritual law?\n\nFor those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\nbe \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\nit is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\ndetermine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the\nwhole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: \"No doubt I am free to do anything.\"\nBut Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,\nthe Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go\nthrough Leviticus and decide each \"command\" there on that basis, then\nyour own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this\ncontext, it is remarkably offensive to say:\n\n>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the\n>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.\n\nWell, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the\none that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously\n(though one can always find jokers) in \"defense\" of bestiality.  It is\nabsolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\nraise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\nadult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\nthan the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you\nare being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the\nworld.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not\nmine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in\nour culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing\nus as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means\nyou can think of to do so.\n\nJesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,\nthe central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to\nlove one another, and ALL else depends on that.

The teacher of the class is what I consider to be\nclosed-minded and bigotted on the subject of what the definition of\nChristianity is.

As the\nprevious discussion of the Trinity did not lend itself to an exchange\nof flames, I am hopeful that this will also not produce major\nflames.\n\nRegards,\n--\nLarry Autry\nSilicon Graphics, St. Louis\nautry@sgi.com \n\n\n\n[Often we get into discussions about who is Christian.  Unfortunately\nthere are a number of possible definitions.  Starting from the \nbroadest, commonly used definitions are:\n\n  a historical definition\n  people who accept Christ as Lord and savior\n  a broad doctrinal definition\n  narrow doctrinal definitions\n\n1) By a historical definition I mean the sort of definition a secular\nhistorian would likely use.  This would include any group that\ndeveloped out of the Christian church, and continues within the same\nbroad culture.  E.g. some Unitarians would fail just about any\ndoctrinal test you could come up with.  Yet it's clear that that group\ndeveloped from Christianity, and people from very different\nbackgrounds (e.g. Hindus) would likely see them as part of\nChristianity.  This is not a definition most Christians like, but it's\nrelevant in some political and ethnic contexts.\n\n2) Accepting Christ as Lord and savior is a test used by many\nChristian groups for membership, e.g. the Southern Baptists and\nPresbyterian Church (USA).  I would qualify it by saying that what\nmost people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to Christ, so that\nsomeone who accepted Christ as one of many gods would not fit.  It's\nan attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not based\non technical doctrine.  By this definition, groups such as Arians\nwould be viewed as heretical Christians, but still Christians.  In the\nmodern context this would include Mormons, JW's, and \"oneness\nPentecostals\".  They would be viewed as heretical Christians, but\nstill Christian.  In practice I believe just about everyone who falls\ninto this category would accept the Apostle's Creed.\n\n3) The next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition,\nwhich includes all of the major strands of Christianity, but excludes\ngroups that are felt to be outside \"historic Christianity.\"  This is\nof course a slippery enterprise, since Catholics could argue that\nProtestants are outside historic Christianity, etc.  But I think the\nmost commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the\nNicene Creed and the Formula of Chalcedon.  The attempt is to\ncharacterize doctrines that all major strands of Christianity agree\nare key.  Obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement.  A\nMormon will regard the LDS church as a major strand, and thus will not\nwant to include anything that contradicts their beliefs.  But I think\nthis definition would have fairly broad acceptance.\n\n4) Finally, some people use definitions that I would say are limited\nto a specific Christian tradition.  E.g. some evangelicals only\nconsider someone Christian if he has had an evangelical-style\nconversion experience, and some I've even heard of groups that limit\nit to their specific church.\n\nI think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used.\nA lot is going to depend upon the purpose you're using it for.  If\nyou're using it descriptively, e.g. in history or anthropology, you'll\nprobably use definition 1 or 2.  If you're using it normatively, i.e.\nto say what you believe the Christian message is, you'll probably use\na definition like 3 or even 4.\n\n--clh]\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 8 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: Alan.Olsen@p17.f40.n105.z1.fidonet.org (Alan Olsen)\nSubject: After 2000 years, can we say that Christian Morality is\nLines: 29\n\n\nMC> Theory of Creationism: MY theistic view of the theory of\nMC> creationism, (there  are many others) is stated in Genesis\nMC> 1.

Dr. James DeYoung; #3]\n\nR. Scroggs\n\n     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and\nsuggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a\n\"Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic\nterminology.\"  The term is derived from Lev 18\"22 & 20:13 where the LXX\njuxtaposes the two words arsenos (\"male\") and koiten (\"bed\"), and represents\nthe Hebrew miskab zabar (\"lying with a male\").   Yet he believes that Paul did\nnot originate the term, but borrowed it from \"circles of Hellenistic Jews\nacquainted with rabbinic discussions\" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid\n\"contact with the usual Greek terminology\" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs\nobserves, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions\nof pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to\nnative-speaking Greeks (108).\n\n     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the\nobject of the second part, thus differing from Boswell's \"learned discussion\"\n(107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of \"one who lies with a\nmale\" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9),\nwhich Scroggs interprets as \"the effeminate call-boy,\" arsenokoitai is the\nactive partner \"who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress' or who hires him on\noccasion to satisfy his sexual desires\" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not\nrefer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic\nmodel of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he\naffirms (109).\n     This is Scrogg's interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The\ncombination of pornoi (\"fornicators\"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai (\"slave\ndealers\") refers to \"male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave\ndealers [who procure them]\" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of\npederasty \"which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual\npurposes, and the use of these boys by adult males\" (121).  Even \"serious\nminded pagan authors\" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these\ninstances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently\ngeneral condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. \nConsequently Paul \"Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind\" (122).\nWe cannot know what Paul would have said about the \"contemporary model of\nadult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships\" (122).\n\n     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical\nconcerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of\nvices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and\nfunction of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any\nrelationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually\nnonexistent.  He concludes that Paul \"does not care about any specific item in\nthe lists\" (104). \n\n     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary\nphenomenon of a \"catalogue of vices,\"  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are\n\"irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today\" (129).  The \"model\nin today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model\nattacked by the NT\" that \"Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not\nrelevant to today's debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational\ndiscussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify\nrefusal of ordination. . . \" (127).\n\n      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI\n\nD. Wright\n\n     In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have\ncome under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell's\nview is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out\nseveral shortcomings of Boswell's treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults\nBoswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev\n18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the \"Apostolic\nConstitutions,\"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). \nBoswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term\nderives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This\nis significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell's\nclaim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the\ngender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean \"a male who sleeps with\na male,\" making arseno- the object.\n\n     Wright also faults Boswell's claims regarding linguistic features of the\nterm, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that\ncompounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it\nas an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely\none of dialectical diversity: \"No semantic import attaches to the difference\nbetween the two forms\" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which\nthe second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its\nobject and where \"the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its\ngender\" (132). \n\n     It is with Boswell's treatment of the early church fathers that Wright\ntakes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. \nFor example, Aristides' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis,\nandrobaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male\nhomosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell's discussion.  Boswell fails to cite\nHippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the\nSyriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to\nthe Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34). \n\n     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in\nparallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the\ndominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this\nparallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia (\"adultery\"), porneia\n(\"fornication\"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris\n(136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the\nTen Commandments as \"You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis (\"you shall not commit\nadultery\"), ou paidophthoreseis (\"you shall not practice homosexuality with\nboys\"), you shall not steal. . .\" (150 n. 43).\n\n     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein (\"commit homosexuality\") exists in the\nSibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was\ncoined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by\nOr.Sib., book 2 (137-38).\n\n     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew\nupon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John\nthe Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of\nhomosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.\n\n     Wright next replies to Boswell's contention that the term would not be\nabsent \"from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted\n(140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to\nthe first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used\ndozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g.\nDidache) show no acquaintance with Paul's letters or deliberately avoid citing\nScripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). \n\n     Boswell's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright's attention\n(141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom,\nomitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a\nlong uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom\n1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom's infrequent use of the term.  Wright\nobserves that Boswell has \"signally failed to demonstrate any us of\narsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual\nactivity\" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature\nand the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly\nspecified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world. \n\n     Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim\nand I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning\n\"homosexual\" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of\nthe word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell's limited\nconclusion based on them.\n\n     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the\ncatalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed\nin late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of\nhomosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the\npart of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into\nbeing under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke \"generally of\nmale activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual\nengagement with paides\" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were\ninterchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).\n\n     In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning\nhomosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and\nothers who limit the term to \"active male prostitutes\" or pederasty are without\nsignificant support from linguistic and historical studies.  \n\n[Next: the questioning of Wrights position by William Peterson.  After that, we\nget into the \"good\" stuff of historical & linguistic studies.  THis will\ninclude \"Symposium\" by Plato.  If there is any doubt as to the modern\nunderstanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time of\nPaul, this will certainly clear things up.  Also we will review Paul's use of\nLev18-20 in the NT and how, as for him, 1) the Law was fulfilled, but not done\naway with, 2) Lev 18-20 was the universal and the following chapters the\ngeneral.  Those who put forth that the OT no longer holds true today in our\nculture, should stick around for this one.]\n___________________________\n13 R. Scroggs, THe New Testament and Homosexuality (Phil: 1983) 86, 107-8. \nIndependently we came to the same conclusion.  Apparently the connection is\nmade in E.A. Sophocles, Greek Lexicon of the Roman & Byzantine Periods (from\n146BC to AD 1100).\n14   See discussion, 101-4.  He says the same thing about Paul's language in\nRom 1:26-27 (128).  But this is doubtful.  See the more cautious words of P.\nZaas, \"I Cor 6.9ff: Was Homosexuality Condoned in the Corinthian Church? SBLASP\n17 (1979):205-12.  He observes that the words moixai, malakoi, and arsenokoitai\nwere part of Jewish anti-Gentile polemic.  Yet Paul's wors at the end of the\nvice list, \"and such were some of you,\" indicate that \"Paul is addressing real\nor potential abuses of his ethical message, not citing primitive tradition by\nrote\" (210).  Wright disputes Zaas' attempt to associate the term with idolatry\n(147).\n15  On Boswell's treatment of Rom 1:26-7, the article by R.B. Hays, \"Relations\nNatural and Unnatural\"  A Response to John Boswell's Exegesis of Romans 1,\" JRE\n14/1 (Spring 1986): 184-215, is an excellent critique.\n16  D.F. Wright, \"Homosexuals or Prostitutes?  The Meaning of ARSENOKOITAI (I\nCor 6:9, I Tim 1:10), VC 38 (1984):125-53.\n17  In an unpublished paper, Henry Mendell, \"ARSENOKOITAI: Boswell on Paul,\"\neffectively refutres Boswell's claims regarding the philology of arsenokoitai. \nHe finds the meaning to be general, \"a male who has sex with a male\" (4-11).  \n18  Wright's endnotes (148-49) list additional sources in the church fathers.\n19   We also have noticed the same tendency by Boswell to fail to cite all the\nreferences to Sodom and sodomy in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha.  See  J.B.\nDeYoung, \"A Critique of Prohomosexual Interpretations of the OT Apocrypha and\nPseudepigrapha,\" BSac 146/588 (1990):437-53.\n20   In light of the claim made by Boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitai\npoints to a meaning lacking homosexual significance, Wright asks pertinently\n\"why neither Philo nor Josephus use  paidofthoria, nor Josephus paiderastia,\nand why . . Clement did not use the latter and Chrysostom the former?\"  (152 n.\n71)  In a more recent article, \"Homosexuality: The Relevance of the Bible,\" EvQ\n61 (1989):291-300, Wright reiterates these same points.  Paul shows a\n\"remarkable originality\" in extending the OT ethic to the church (300).\n\n \n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 12 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: kadie@cs.uiuc.edu (Carl M Kadie)\nSubject: [UPI] \"Mother files complaint over Boy Scouts\"\nKeywords: children, special interest, gambling, human interest, \tchildren's education, education\nOrganization: University of Illinois, Dept. of Comp.

For example, there\nwas only one Jesus (presumably), and he probably didn't say all that many\nthings, and yet (seemingly) billions and billions of Christian sects have\narisen.  Perhaps there is one that is totally dedicated to rationalism and\nbelieves in Christ as in pantheism.  It would seem to go against the Bible, but\nit is amazing what people come up with under the guise of \"personal\ninterpretation\".\n\n> A philosopher cannot be a Christian because a philosopher can change his mind,\n> whereas a Christian cannot, due to the nature of faith and dogma present\n> in any religion.\n\nThis is a good point.  We have here the quintessential Christian: he sets up a\nsystem of values/beliefs for himself, which work very well, and every\nevent/experience is understandable and deablable within the framework of this\nsystem.  However, we also have an individual who has the inability (at least\nnot without some difficulty) to change, which is important, because the problem\nwith such a system is the same as with any system: one cannot be open minded to\nthe point of \"testing hypotheses\" against the basic premise of the system\nwithout destroying whatever faith is invested therein, unless of course, all\nthe tests fail.  In other words, the *fairer* way would be to test and evaluate\nmoralities without the bias/responsibility of losing/retaining a system.\n\n> \n> I claimed that a ``Christian philosopher'' is not a Christian,\n> but is a person whose beliefs at the moment correspond with those\n> of Christianity.

A generation\nbefore the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh,\ngateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather\nthan God's way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which would\nhave given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored their\ndecision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the\nland of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision-\nmakers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and\ndestined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the\ntime they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderers\nhad been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with a\nsigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they\nwere going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence.\nWhatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached\nbones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression of\nhopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nation\nat Kadesh and had God' s promise of one day entering the land. The\nforty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, those\nwho were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the\ninheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Moses\nprays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over.\nAll these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining\npeople through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden.\nHis was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but\nhe also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem was\nthat they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. \"Who is your\nGod?\" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. When\nAaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or young\nbull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bull\nwho had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt's gods as He led\nIsrael to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles grow\nthin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and water\ngushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the\nGod of Almightiness becomes \"ho-hum --What' s next on the miracle menu?\"\nAnd a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He might\nbe all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a right\nto do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these people\nhad known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men's lives had hung\non the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believed\nGod could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIM\nand, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, His\nacts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From the\nday of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God.\nAt Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. He\nhad seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. This\nrequest was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God's glorious\nPerson. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and\nlovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word \"lovingkindness\" is not to be\nunderstood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationship\narising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as the\nlove that says, \"I will never leave you nor forsake you.\" Lovingkindness is as\ntenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its\nheels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based on\nfeelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and,\ntherefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God's love is not an emotion\nthat wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our\nhighest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. God\ndoes not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings\nof love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with\nus! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Him\nto reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- not\nbecause of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committed\nto us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He will\nnot let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us--\nbut a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It is\nsaying to the recipient, \"For as long as we shall live, I am for you.\"  The God\nwho has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--in\nHis coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who is\nlovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will never\nleave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him as\nlove; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeing\nmiracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in the\nheart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power.\nMoses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had for\nthese people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, they\ncould not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born out\nof knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One who\ngives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is to\nmiss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  If\nman is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on\nknowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues from\nlove demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years of\nmeaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to\nknow the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and the\npossibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. The\nlanguage Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its\nmother's love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It is\nwaking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for,\nprotected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we were\nto ask, \"What has the baby done to deserve this?\" or, \"Have arrangements\nbeen made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?\" Our\nquestions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child was\nconceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love's excitement, a love\nthat has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents' love is\nunconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child\nor its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally,\nspontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after\nHis image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the\nLord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to\nearn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identity\nthrough the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents' love. It is a\nscientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if\nit survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has been\nheld and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the\nembrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the new\ngeneration will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in\nthe love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and\ngladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His\nlove. \"Satisfied.\" in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing\nbeing filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describe\nthe earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received\nenough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be\ndrenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is the\nlifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in our\ndeepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems\ndisappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling\nthat he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make\nsense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks this\nsatisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the\nemotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in\nreligious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding\nto the love of the living God. Only in knowing God's love will the rest of life\nmake sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again\nbecame the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find it\nfascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His\nlove. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one would\nthink he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by\nthe knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knew\nbetter. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won't\nfind it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to\nmanipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and\ngive us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyes\nand satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking God\nto make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses' prayer was partially\nanswered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which\nworked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in its\nfullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out the\nlove of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church,\nwe read of the Holy Spirit \"falling upon\" the believers. This is an ancient\nexpression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used in\nLuke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and \"falling on his\nneck and kissing him.\" The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest\nself and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your\nbeing. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes.\nMoses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization\nthat we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taught\nus to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in a\nstate of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance\nand love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive love\nwe cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the Holy\nSpirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness to\nthink on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jaded\nwith the doctrine of \"perform to be accepted.\" We begin to realize that He\nloves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challenge\neveryone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your\neyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may not\nfeel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed the\nother day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians kept\nbehind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rays\nwithout being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing\nthat we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according to\nMoses, \"joy and gladness all our days.\" Joy is the result of a life that is\nfunctioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might say\nthat joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. Man' s highest\nperformance is to rest in the love God has for him... the hum will be joy, and\nthe result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now\nhas in life. Stop wandering in the wilderness. Be satisfied with His love and,\nin joy, day by day, receive all His promised blessings.\n\n\n----- End Included Message -----\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 18 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: kempmp@phoenix.oulu.fi (Petri Pihko)\nSubject: Re: Christian Morality is\nOrganization: University of Oulu, Finland\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL9]\nLines: 107\n\nDan Schaertel,,, (dps@nasa.kodak.com) wrote:\n> In article 21627@ousrvr.oulu.fi, kempmp@phoenix.oulu.fi (Petri Pihko) writes:\n\n> |>I love god just as much as she loves me.

I would think that would be great _fun_, not having ever\nfelt the joy and peace the Christians speak of with a longing gaze.\nThis is not what I got when I believed - I just tried to hide my fear\nof getting punished for something I never was sure of. The Bible is\nhopelessly confusing for someone who wants to know for sure. God did\nnot answer. In the end, I found I had been following a mass delusion,\na lie. I can't believe in a being who refuses to give a slightest hint\nof her existence.\n\n> Obviously there are many Christians who have tried and do believe. So .. ?\n\nI suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe\nand analyse their position. In fact, it is amusing to note in this\ncontext that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the\nopposite - one should not examine one's belief critically.\n\nI'll tell you something I left out of my 'testimony' I posted to this\ngroup two months ago. A day after I finally found out my faith is over,\nI decided to try just one more time. The same cycle of emotional\nresponses fired once again, but this time the delusion lasted only\na couple of hours. I told my friend in a phone that it really works,\nthank god, just to think about it again when I hung up. I had to admit\nthat I had lied, and fallen prey to the same illusion.\n\n> No one asks you to swallow everything, in fact Jesus warns against it.   But let\n> me ask you a question.

I learned what it means to use _reason_.\n\nAs a student of chemistry, I had to perform a qualitative analysis\nof a mixture of two organic compounds in the lab. I _hated_ experiments\nlike this - they are old-fashioned and increase the student's workload\nconsiderably. Besides, I had to do it twice, since I failed in my first\nattempt. However, I think I'll never forget the lesson: \n\nNo matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is X,\nit may still be Y. It is _very_ tempting to jump into conclusions, take\na leap of faith, assure oneself, ignore the data which is inconsistent. \nBut it can still be wrong. \n\nI found out that I was, after all, using exactly the same mechanism\nto believe in god - mental self-assurance, suspension of fear, \nfiltering of information. In other words, it was only me, no god\nplaying any part. \n\n> The life , death, and resurection of Christ is documented historical fact.\n\nOh? And I had better believe this? Dan, many UFO stories are much better\ndocumented than the resurrection of Jesus. The resurrection is documented\nquite haphazardly in the Bible - it seems the authors did not pay too\nmuch attention to which wild rumour to leave out. Besides, the ends of\nthe gospels probably contain later additions and insertions; for instance,\nthe end of Mark (16:9-20) is missing from many early texts, says my Bible.\n\nJesus may have lived and died, but he was probably misunderstood.\n\n> As much\n> as anything else you learn.  How do you choose what to believe and \n> what not to?\n\nThis is easy. I believe that the world exists independent of my mind,\nand that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what I\nobserve. Nothing else need to be taken on faith, I will go by the\nevidence. \n\nIt makes no difference whether I believe George Washington existed or not.\nI assume that he did, considering the vast amount of evidence presented.\n\n> There is no way to get into a sceptical heart.

It seems it is \nvery difficult to admit that someone who has really believed does not\ndo so anymore. But I can't go on lying to myself.\n\nBlind trust is dangerous, and I was just another blind led by the blind.\nBut if god really wants me, she'll know what to do. I'm willing.

But if you can contrive\nto control the action in dreams or do an OOBE, it seems like a morality applies.\n\nNow, there seem to be 3 alternatives:\n\n1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.  In this case no morality\napplies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene', that is, not trying\nto think about anything evil, or indulgining in overly sexy or violent\nthoughts.\n\n2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane')\nEvidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in\ncommon by more than one person.  A\nmark of objective fact is that >1 people report the same objective experience.\nIn this case, the same interpersonal morality/ethics applies in dreams and\nOOBEs as does in waking life.\n\n3) Like (2), but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have a\nreal existence, a different moral/ethics apply there, and no (or maybe \ndifferent) moral laws apply there.\n\nSo... There it is.

Karma is considered to\nbe a moral process in which intentions (either good or evil) shape\na person's predilections for future intention and action and\nproduce a person who is more prone to good than evil, or the opposite --\n\"reward\" has nothing to do with it.

I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of\nactivity that could be named by \"fornication\" or \"theft\" or \"coveting\" or\n\"reviling\" or \"drunkenness\" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may\nor may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very\nfact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at\nall \"clear\" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest\nin MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,\nwith all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated\nChristian discussion of ALL these areas.\n\nHomosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I\nknow) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and\nchild molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly\n\"harmless\" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --\nthat would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter\nyou cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that\nyou want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]\n\n\t\"'I am free to do anything,' you say.  Yes, but not everything\n\tis for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one\n\twill not let anything make free with me.\"  [1 Cor. 6:12]\n\nWhich is a restatement that we must have no other \"god\" before God.  A\ncommandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some\npeople are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.\nIt is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary\nargument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such\nbehavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers.\n\nI won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.\nFundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your\nassumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of\nlaws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of\nwhich Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine\nthem.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are \"moral\" and\nwhich ones are \"ritual.\"  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology\ncourse should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories\nin an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).\nAnd I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus\nfrom the \"ritual law\" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.\n\nI'm dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this\nmatter) about how \"repulsive\" and \"unnatural\" our acts are -- and what\ndo they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of\narbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating\ninsects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you\nsay that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part\nof the ritual law?\n\nFor those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\nbe \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\nit is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\ndetermine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the\nwhole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: \"No doubt I am free to do anything.\"\nBut Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,\nthe Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go\nthrough Leviticus and decide each \"command\" there on that basis, then\nyour own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this\ncontext, it is remarkably offensive to say:\n\n>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the\n>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.\n\nWell, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the\none that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously\n(though one can always find jokers) in \"defense\" of bestiality.  It is\nabsolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\nraise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\nadult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\nthan the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you\nare being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the\nworld.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not\nmine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in\nour culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing\nus as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means\nyou can think of to do so.\n\nJesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,\nthe central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to\nlove one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-\nians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get\nin return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.\n\nChristians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every\ncorner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same\nold verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never\neven read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with\nthe vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\nmanage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great\nemotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even\ntaking the trouble to find out what it is.\n\nSuch behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.\nWHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to\ncondemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN\nto BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?\nGod forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or\ncondemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in\ninsisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are\nSO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.\n\nWhy, for God's sake?\n\n\t\"For God did not send the Son into the world\n\tto condemn the world,\n\tbut that the world might be saved through him.\n\tWhoever believes in him is not condemned,\n\tbut whoever does not believe has already been condemned\n\tfor refusing to believe in the name of God's only Son.\n\tNow the judgment is this:\n\tthe light has come into the world,\n\tbut men have preferred darkness to light\n\tbecause their deeds were evil.\n\tFor everyone who practices wickedness\n\thates the light,\n\tand does not come near the light\n\tfor fear his deeds will be exposed.\n\tBut he who acts in truth\n\tcomes into the light,\n\tso that it may be sh0own\n\tthat his deeds are done in God.\"\tJohn 3:17-21\n\nFor long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from\nevil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and\nrejected.  Some of us despaired and took to courses that probably *do*\nshow a sinful shunning of God's light.  Blessed are those whose spirits\nhave been crushed by the self-righteous; they shall be justified.\n\nHowever, we have seen the Truth, and the Truth is the light of humanity;\nand we now know that it is not WE who fear the light, but our enemies who\nfear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadow\nit with the darkness of false witness against us.\n-- \nMichael L.

STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC\n\n\tYour natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to\npanic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get right\nwith God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your \nonly chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the \nTribulation.  \"But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be \nsaved.\" - Matthew 24:13\n\nII. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION\n\n\tThe Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of\nthe rapture until Christ's second coming.  Also know as \"the time of Jacob's\n(Israel's) trouble\" (Jere 30:7) and \"Daniel's Seventieth Week\" (Dan 9), this \nperiod will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.\n\nIII. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM\n\n\tSoon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community \n(the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will\nbe tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable \npossession during the Tribulation.\n\nIV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tSince all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it\nis imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can\nquote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, \nRevelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to\nunfold before you.  \n\nV. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tPray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray \nand pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual \nstrength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the\nsake of Christ.  \n\nVI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED\nONES DIE AS MARTYRS\n\n\tAfter the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he\nwill institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell,\nor eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be\nuseless.  \"And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and \nslave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that\nno one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, \nor the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding\ncalculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number\nis 666\" - Revelation 13:16-18.  \n\tThe Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of \nhumanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed\nin the past, such as the Holocaust.\n[or maybe the crusades? -M]\nYou cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's\nrule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) \"...I saw\nunder the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and\nfor the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of \nthem: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, \nuntil both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be\nkilled as they were, was completed.\" Revelation 6:9, 11.\n\tHis targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image\nor take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ \"...And I saw the souls of \nthose who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of \nGod, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark\non their foreheads or on the hands.\" - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every\nform of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor\nwill he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, \ntorturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take\nthe mark.  \n\tIf you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,\nyou will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.\n[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]\nYou cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and\ngain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake\nof Fire.  \"...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his \nmark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of\nthe wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His \nindignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the \npresence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.\" -Revelation \n14:9-10 \n\n[and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to\nthe first 5,000 at the stadium --M] \n\nVII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL\n\n\tAlthough you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist's government\nuntil the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is \nimportant for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are\nextremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.\n\tThe first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or\nmountainous area, for the Antichrist's control will come last to the least\npopulated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay \nattuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.\n[\"As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep\ninto our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school\nclosings\" --M] \nStore water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without\nthe mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste\nfrom nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.\n[Get a good water filter. --M]\nBring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,\nbatteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to \nsurvive and live off the land as the pioneers did.\n\nVIII. TRUST NO ONE\n\t\n\tThere will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist's\ngovernment.  Be on the lookout.\n[Perot supporters take note --M]\n\nIX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST\n\n\tIt is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,\nfor he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will\nbring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel \n11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a\nhalf years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be \nphysically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and \npersonality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic\nexpert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which\nhe will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural \npower that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will\nbe deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.\n[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]\n\tThe antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who\nwill make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  \nAll who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and\na half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.\n\nX. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!\n\n\tThe seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of\nChrist.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you \nwill be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  \n\tStart reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of \nyour sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take\nthe mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or\nremain saved, but this time you will have to be \"faithful unto death.\"\n\n\tMay God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!\n\n******************************************************************************\nMike Cluff\t\t\t\t*  \"Christianity is Stupid.\nv22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms\t*   Give up.\" -Negativland\nUB Language Perception Laboratory\t*  \n******************************************************************************\n\n\n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\ \n\nBob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM \n\nThey said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,\nand sank Manhattan out at sea.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n", "true_class": 0, "title": "ID 94 (TN-FP)"}, {"text": "From: perry@dsinc.com (Jim Perry)\nSubject: Re: Who has read Rushdie's _The Satanic Verses_?\nOrganization: Decision Support Inc.\nLines: 34\nNNTP-Posting-Host: bozo.dsinc.com\n\nIn article <37410@optima.cs.arizona.edu> sham@cs.arizona.edu (Shamim Zvonko Mohamed) writes:\n>In article <1r1cl7INNknk@bozo.dsinc.com> perry@dsinc.com (Jim Perry) writes:\n>>Anyway, since I seem to be the only one following this particular line\n>>of discussion, I wonder how many of the rest of the readership have\n>>read this book?

Unfortunately\nthere are a number of possible definitions.

This would include any group that\ndeveloped out of the Christian church, and continues within the same\nbroad culture.  E.g. some Unitarians would fail just about any\ndoctrinal test you could come up with.  Yet it's clear that that group\ndeveloped from Christianity, and people from very different\nbackgrounds (e.g. Hindus) would likely see them as part of\nChristianity.  This is not a definition most Christians like, but it's\nrelevant in some political and ethnic contexts.\n\n2) Accepting Christ as Lord and savior is a test used by many\nChristian groups for membership, e.g. the Southern Baptists and\nPresbyterian Church (USA).  I would qualify it by saying that what\nmost people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to Christ, so that\nsomeone who accepted Christ as one of many gods would not fit.  It's\nan attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not based\non technical doctrine.  By this definition, groups such as Arians\nwould be viewed as heretical Christians, but still Christians.  In the\nmodern context this would include Mormons, JW's, and \"oneness\nPentecostals\".  They would be viewed as heretical Christians, but\nstill Christian.  In practice I believe just about everyone who falls\ninto this category would accept the Apostle's Creed.\n\n3) The next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition,\nwhich includes all of the major strands of Christianity, but excludes\ngroups that are felt to be outside \"historic Christianity.\"  This is\nof course a slippery enterprise, since Catholics could argue that\nProtestants are outside historic Christianity, etc.  But I think the\nmost commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the\nNicene Creed and the Formula of Chalcedon.  The attempt is to\ncharacterize doctrines that all major strands of Christianity agree\nare key.  Obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement.  A\nMormon will regard the LDS church as a major strand, and thus will not\nwant to include anything that contradicts their beliefs.  But I think\nthis definition would have fairly broad acceptance.\n\n4) Finally, some people use definitions that I would say are limited\nto a specific Christian tradition.  E.g. some evangelicals only\nconsider someone Christian if he has had an evangelical-style\nconversion experience, and some I've even heard of groups that limit\nit to their specific church.\n\nI think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used.\nA lot is going to depend upon the purpose you're using it for.  If\nyou're using it descriptively, e.g. in history or anthropology, you'll\nprobably use definition 1 or 2.  If you're using it normatively, i.e.\nto say what you believe the Christian message is, you'll probably use\na definition like 3 or even 4.\n\n--clh]\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 8 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: conor@owlnet.rice.edu (Conor Frederick Prischmann)\nSubject: Re: Genocide is Caused by Theism : Evidence?\nOrganization: Rice University\nLines: 23\n\nIn article <C60A0s.DvI@mailer.cc.fsu.edu> dekorte@dirac.scri.fsu.edu (Stephen L.

Your reasoning, as I see it, is very much along the\nlines of Roger Penrose, who claimed that mathematical 'insight' cannot\nbe algorithmic in his book _The emperor's new mind: Concerning\ncomputers, minds, and the laws of physics_. However, Penrose's\nclaim that he _has_ mathematical insight, or your similar claim\nthat wavefunctions collapse only when we consciously take a look,\ncould be just illusions.\n\nWe are obviouslu taking very different viewpoints - I try to ponder\non the problem of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective,\nrealising that it might not be anything special, but certainly\nuseful. Thinking back of what I wrote, do you think worms have minds\nor not? They are able to experience pain, at least they behave \njust like that. Yet it is conceivable that we might some day\nin the future perform a \"total synthesis of C. elegans\" from\nthe elements. Would such a worm have a mind?\n\n> Firstly, I'm not impressed with the ability of algorithms.

However, I do not think that our brains\nwork like computers, at all. In fact, there is substantial evidence\n(Skarda, 1985; Skarda & Freeman 1987) that brains work more or less\nchaotically, generating enough randomness for mental states to evolve.\nOur brains work much like genetic algorithm generators, I suppose.\n\n> the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered.

I suggest, however, that before trying to\nunderstand our consciousness as a collection of algorithms. \n\nKevin, take a look at the references I mentioned, and think again.\nI still think the best experts on the nature of a conscious mind\nare neurologists, neuropsychologists and biologists (but do not \nflame me for my opinions), since they study beings that are\nconscious. \n\nThe reason I am repeating my advice is that this discussion cannot\nlead to anywhere if our backgrounds are too different.\n\nAnd please, do not bring QM into this discussion at all - not\nall physicists are happy with the claim that our consciousness\nplays some special role in physics. I would say it doesn't.\n\n> The other problem with algorithms is their instability.

Also,\n> neurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate -\n> can an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it's\n> code?\n\nAgain, _brains are not computers_. Don't forget this. This does not\nmean they need something else to work - they just work differently.\nTheir primary 'purpose' is perception and guidance of action, \nself-awareness and high intelligence are later appearances.\n\n> The next problem is the sticky question of \"What is colour?\" (replace\n> 'colour' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, the\n> materialist viewpoint is that it's the product of some kind of\n> chemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy +\n> different chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these?\n\nYou are still expecting that we could find the idea of 'green' in\nour brains somewhere, perhaps in the form of some chemical. This is\nnot how I see it. The sensation 'green' is a certain time-dependent\npattern in the area V4 of our visual cortex, and it is distributed\nwith the help of areas V1 and V2 to the rest of the brain. \n\nIndeed, a firing pattern. I have sometimes thought of our consciousness\nas a global free induction pattern of these local firing patterns,\nbut this is just idle speculation.\n\nScientific American's September 1992 issue was a special issue on\nmind and brain. Have you already read it from cover to cover? ;-)\nThere are two articles on visual perception, so you might be \ninterested.\n\nBut again, please note that subjective experiences cannot be \nobserved from a third-person perspective. If we see nothing but \nneuronal activity, we cannot go on to conclude that this is not the\nmind.\n\nKalat (1988) writes about numerous examples where electric stimulation\nof different areas of brain have led to various changes in the \npatients' state of mind. For instance, a patient whose septal area\nwas stimulated (without his knowledge) by remote control during\na psychiatric interview was quickly cured of his depression, and\nstarted discussing a plan to seduce his girlfriend.\n\nStimulations in the temporal lobe have sometimes led to embarrassing\nsituations, when the patients have started flirting with the\ntherapist.\n\nIn conclusion, there is evidence that\n\n1) brains are essentially necessary for subjective experiences, \n   brain damage is usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage\n\n2) conscious processes involve substantial brain activity in\n   various areas of brain - when we think of colours, our\n   visual cortex is activated etc.\n\n3) consciousness is an afterthought - we become conscious of our\n   actions with a half a second delay, and our brains are ahead\n   of our 'conscious will' by at least 350 ms. \n\nThus, I think it is fruitful to turn the question \"Why do 'I' see\ncolours\" around and ask \"What is this 'I' that seems to be \nobserving?\", since it seems that our conscious mind is not\nthe king of our brains.\n\n> If this is so, a\n> computer won't see colour, because the chemistry is different.

Does a neural\nnetwork that is capable of recognising handwritten numbers from\n0 to 9 see the numbers, if it is capable of sorting them?\n\nIf you are asking, \"why does an animal who is conscious of itself\nas an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal who\ndoesn't\", I have a good answer - read my previous posting,\nwhere I wrote why a sense of identity helps social animals to swap\nroles and act more morally, so that they don't unconsciously\nkill each other with newly discovered weapons. (A bit extreme,\nbut this is the basic idea.)\n\nWhen early _Homo_ became more and more efficient in using tools, \na sense of identity and the concept of 'self' had to evolve in\nline with this development. Indeed, respect for others and \nconscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantages\nfor social animals, such as early humans. \n\n> If I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction,\n> with two processes acting on it.

Dr. James DeYoung; #3]\n\nR. Scroggs\n\n     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and\nsuggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a\n\"Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic\nterminology.\"  The term is derived from Lev 18\"22 & 20:13 where the LXX\njuxtaposes the two words arsenos (\"male\") and koiten (\"bed\"), and represents\nthe Hebrew miskab zabar (\"lying with a male\").   Yet he believes that Paul did\nnot originate the term, but borrowed it from \"circles of Hellenistic Jews\nacquainted with rabbinic discussions\" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid\n\"contact with the usual Greek terminology\" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs\nobserves, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions\nof pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to\nnative-speaking Greeks (108).\n\n     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the\nobject of the second part, thus differing from Boswell's \"learned discussion\"\n(107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of \"one who lies with a\nmale\" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9),\nwhich Scroggs interprets as \"the effeminate call-boy,\" arsenokoitai is the\nactive partner \"who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress' or who hires him on\noccasion to satisfy his sexual desires\" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not\nrefer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic\nmodel of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he\naffirms (109).\n     This is Scrogg's interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The\ncombination of pornoi (\"fornicators\"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai (\"slave\ndealers\") refers to \"male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave\ndealers [who procure them]\" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of\npederasty \"which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual\npurposes, and the use of these boys by adult males\" (121).  Even \"serious\nminded pagan authors\" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these\ninstances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently\ngeneral condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. \nConsequently Paul \"Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind\" (122).\nWe cannot know what Paul would have said about the \"contemporary model of\nadult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships\" (122).\n\n     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical\nconcerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of\nvices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and\nfunction of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any\nrelationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually\nnonexistent.  He concludes that Paul \"does not care about any specific item in\nthe lists\" (104). \n\n     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary\nphenomenon of a \"catalogue of vices,\"  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are\n\"irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today\" (129).  The \"model\nin today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model\nattacked by the NT\" that \"Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not\nrelevant to today's debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational\ndiscussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify\nrefusal of ordination. . . \" (127).\n\n      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI\n\nD. Wright\n\n     In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have\ncome under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell's\nview is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out\nseveral shortcomings of Boswell's treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults\nBoswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev\n18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the \"Apostolic\nConstitutions,\"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). \nBoswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term\nderives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This\nis significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell's\nclaim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the\ngender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean \"a male who sleeps with\na male,\" making arseno- the object.\n\n     Wright also faults Boswell's claims regarding linguistic features of the\nterm, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that\ncompounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it\nas an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely\none of dialectical diversity: \"No semantic import attaches to the difference\nbetween the two forms\" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which\nthe second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its\nobject and where \"the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its\ngender\" (132). \n\n     It is with Boswell's treatment of the early church fathers that Wright\ntakes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. \nFor example, Aristides' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis,\nandrobaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male\nhomosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell's discussion.  Boswell fails to cite\nHippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the\nSyriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to\nthe Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34). \n\n     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in\nparallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the\ndominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this\nparallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia (\"adultery\"), porneia\n(\"fornication\"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris\n(136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the\nTen Commandments as \"You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis (\"you shall not commit\nadultery\"), ou paidophthoreseis (\"you shall not practice homosexuality with\nboys\"), you shall not steal. . .\" (150 n. 43).\n\n     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein (\"commit homosexuality\") exists in the\nSibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was\ncoined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by\nOr.Sib., book 2 (137-38).\n\n     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew\nupon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John\nthe Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of\nhomosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.\n\n     Wright next replies to Boswell's contention that the term would not be\nabsent \"from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted\n(140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to\nthe first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used\ndozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g.\nDidache) show no acquaintance with Paul's letters or deliberately avoid citing\nScripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). \n\n     Boswell's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright's attention\n(141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom,\nomitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a\nlong uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom\n1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom's infrequent use of the term.  Wright\nobserves that Boswell has \"signally failed to demonstrate any us of\narsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual\nactivity\" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature\nand the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly\nspecified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world. \n\n     Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim\nand I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning\n\"homosexual\" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of\nthe word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell's limited\nconclusion based on them.\n\n     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the\ncatalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed\nin late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of\nhomosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the\npart of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into\nbeing under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke \"generally of\nmale activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual\nengagement with paides\" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were\ninterchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).\n\n     In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning\nhomosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and\nothers who limit the term to \"active male prostitutes\" or pederasty are without\nsignificant support from linguistic and historical studies.  \n\n[Next: the questioning of Wrights position by William Peterson.  After that, we\nget into the \"good\" stuff of historical & linguistic studies.  THis will\ninclude \"Symposium\" by Plato.  If there is any doubt as to the modern\nunderstanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time of\nPaul, this will certainly clear things up.  Also we will review Paul's use of\nLev18-20 in the NT and how, as for him, 1) the Law was fulfilled, but not done\naway with, 2) Lev 18-20 was the universal and the following chapters the\ngeneral.  Those who put forth that the OT no longer holds true today in our\nculture, should stick around for this one.]\n___________________________\n13 R. Scroggs, THe New Testament and Homosexuality (Phil: 1983) 86, 107-8. \nIndependently we came to the same conclusion.  Apparently the connection is\nmade in E.A. Sophocles, Greek Lexicon of the Roman & Byzantine Periods (from\n146BC to AD 1100).\n14   See discussion, 101-4.  He says the same thing about Paul's language in\nRom 1:26-27 (128).  But this is doubtful.  See the more cautious words of P.\nZaas, \"I Cor 6.9ff: Was Homosexuality Condoned in the Corinthian Church? SBLASP\n17 (1979):205-12.  He observes that the words moixai, malakoi, and arsenokoitai\nwere part of Jewish anti-Gentile polemic.  Yet Paul's wors at the end of the\nvice list, \"and such were some of you,\" indicate that \"Paul is addressing real\nor potential abuses of his ethical message, not citing primitive tradition by\nrote\" (210).  Wright disputes Zaas' attempt to associate the term with idolatry\n(147).\n15  On Boswell's treatment of Rom 1:26-7, the article by R.B. Hays, \"Relations\nNatural and Unnatural\"  A Response to John Boswell's Exegesis of Romans 1,\" JRE\n14/1 (Spring 1986): 184-215, is an excellent critique.\n16  D.F. Wright, \"Homosexuals or Prostitutes?  The Meaning of ARSENOKOITAI (I\nCor 6:9, I Tim 1:10), VC 38 (1984):125-53.\n17  In an unpublished paper, Henry Mendell, \"ARSENOKOITAI: Boswell on Paul,\"\neffectively refutres Boswell's claims regarding the philology of arsenokoitai. \nHe finds the meaning to be general, \"a male who has sex with a male\" (4-11).  \n18  Wright's endnotes (148-49) list additional sources in the church fathers.\n19   We also have noticed the same tendency by Boswell to fail to cite all the\nreferences to Sodom and sodomy in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha.  See  J.B.\nDeYoung, \"A Critique of Prohomosexual Interpretations of the OT Apocrypha and\nPseudepigrapha,\" BSac 146/588 (1990):437-53.\n20   In light of the claim made by Boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitai\npoints to a meaning lacking homosexual significance, Wright asks pertinently\n\"why neither Philo nor Josephus use  paidofthoria, nor Josephus paiderastia,\nand why . . Clement did not use the latter and Chrysostom the former?\"  (152 n.\n71)  In a more recent article, \"Homosexuality: The Relevance of the Bible,\" EvQ\n61 (1989):291-300, Wright reiterates these same points.  Paul shows a\n\"remarkable originality\" in extending the OT ethic to the church (300).\n\n \n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 12 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: acooper@mac.cc.macalstr.edu (Turin Turambar, ME Department of Utter Misery)\nSubject: Re: Faith and Dogma\nOrganization: Macalester College\nLines: 123\n\nIn article <93Apr20.035421edt.47719@neat.cs.toronto.edu>, tgk@cs.toronto.edu (Todd Kelley) writes:\n> In light of what happened in Waco, I need to get something of my\n> chest.\n\nSadly understandable...\n\n> \n> Faith and dogma are dangerous.  \n\nYes.\n\n> \n> Religion inherently encourages the implementation of faith and dogma, and\n> for that reason, I scorn religion.\n> \nTo be fair, you should really qualify this as semitic-western religions, but\nyou basically go ahead and do this later on anyway.\n\n> I have expressed this notion in the past.

They're\ngreat at solving problems once the method has been worked out, but not\nat working out the method itself.\n\nAs a specific example, I like to solve numerical crosswords (not the\nsimple do-the-sums-and-insert-the-answers type, the hard ones.) To do\nthese with any efficiency, you need to figure out a variety of tricks.\nNow, I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles, but\nin doing so you have to work out the tricks _yourself_, and program\nthem into the computer. You can, of course, 'obfuscate' the trick, and\nwrite the program so that it is uncovered, but as far as I can see,\nthe trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered. Does\nthis mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already\npre-programmed into our brains? This is somewhat unlikely, given that\nour brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic\nmaterial, much of which isn't used.\n\nOne way around this is to bring the environment into the equation, but\n(again, as far as I can see) this still has an air of 'if you see\nobject X, then perform action Y,' and we don't seem to get anywhere.\nThe algorithm has to anticipate what it might see, and what\nconclusions to draw from it's experience.\n\nThe other problem with algorithms is their instability. Not many\nalgorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code, yet\npeople survive strokes without going completely haywire (there are\nside-effects, but patients still seem remarkably stable.) Also,\nneurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate -\ncan an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it's\ncode?\n\nThe next problem is the sticky question of \"What is colour?\" (replace\n'colour' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, the\nmaterialist viewpoint is that it's the product of some kind of\nchemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy +\ndifferent chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these? If this is so, a\ncomputer won't see colour, because the chemistry is different. Does an\nalgorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an\nequivalent that doesn't? It shouldn't, because the outputs of each\nalgorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances. So why do\nwe see colour?\n\n\n>\n>However, such a view is actually a nonsolution. How should minds be\n>able to act as observers, feel pain and pleasure and issue\n>commands any better than the brain? Moreover, how do the interactions\n>occur?\n\nA bit of idle speculation...\n\nIf I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction,\nwith two processes acting on it. The first process has been called\n'Unitary Evolution' (or 'U'), is governed by Schroedinger's equation\nand is well known. The second process, called various things such as\n'collapse of the wavefunction' or 'state vector reduction' (or 'R'),\nand is more mysterious. It is usually said to occur when a\n'measurement' takes place, although nobody seems to know precisely\nwhen that occurs. When it does occur, the effect of R is to abruptly\nchange the wavefunction.\n\nI envisage R as an interaction between the wavefunction and 'something\nelse,' which I shall imaginitively call 'part X.' It seems reasonable\nto assume that _something_ causes R, although that something might be\nthe wavefunction itself (in which case, part X is simply the\nwavefunction. Note, though, that we'd need more than U to explain R.)\n\nAnyway, I'm speculating that minds would be in part X. There seems to\nbe some link between consciousness and R, in that we never see linear\nsuperpositions of anything, although there are alternative\nexplainations for this. I've no idea how a brain is supposed to access\npart X, but since this is only speculation, that won't matter too\nmuch :-) My main point is that there might be a place for minds in\nphysics.\n\nI'll go back to my nice padded cell now, if that's OK with you :-)\n\n>\n>\n>Petri\n\n-- \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKevin Anthoney                                         kax@cs.nott.ac.uk\n            Don't believe anything you read in .sig files.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n", "true_class": 0, "title": "ID 365 (FP-TN)"}, {"text": "From: ray@engr.LaTech.edu (Bill Ray)\nSubject: Re: Who Says the Apostles Were Tortured?\nOrganization: Louisiana Tech University\nLines: 20\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: ee02.engr.latech.edu\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]\n\n: The willingness of true believers\n: to die for their belief, be it in Jesus or Jim Jones, is\n: well-documented, so martyrdom in and of itself says little.\n\nIt does say something about the depth of their belief.

A generation\nbefore the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh,\ngateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather\nthan God's way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which would\nhave given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored their\ndecision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the\nland of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision-\nmakers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and\ndestined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the\ntime they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderers\nhad been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with a\nsigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they\nwere going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence.\nWhatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached\nbones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression of\nhopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nation\nat Kadesh and had God' s promise of one day entering the land. The\nforty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, those\nwho were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the\ninheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Moses\nprays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over.\nAll these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining\npeople through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden.\nHis was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but\nhe also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem was\nthat they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. \"Who is your\nGod?\" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. When\nAaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or young\nbull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bull\nwho had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt's gods as He led\nIsrael to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles grow\nthin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and water\ngushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the\nGod of Almightiness becomes \"ho-hum --What' s next on the miracle menu?\"\nAnd a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He might\nbe all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a right\nto do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these people\nhad known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men's lives had hung\non the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believed\nGod could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIM\nand, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, His\nacts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From the\nday of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God.\nAt Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. He\nhad seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. This\nrequest was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God's glorious\nPerson. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and\nlovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word \"lovingkindness\" is not to be\nunderstood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationship\narising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as the\nlove that says, \"I will never leave you nor forsake you.\" Lovingkindness is as\ntenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its\nheels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based on\nfeelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and,\ntherefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God's love is not an emotion\nthat wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our\nhighest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. God\ndoes not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings\nof love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with\nus! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Him\nto reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- not\nbecause of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committed\nto us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He will\nnot let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us--\nbut a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It is\nsaying to the recipient, \"For as long as we shall live, I am for you.\"  The God\nwho has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--in\nHis coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who is\nlovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will never\nleave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him as\nlove; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeing\nmiracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in the\nheart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power.\nMoses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had for\nthese people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, they\ncould not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born out\nof knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One who\ngives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is to\nmiss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  If\nman is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on\nknowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues from\nlove demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years of\nmeaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to\nknow the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and the\npossibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. The\nlanguage Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its\nmother's love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It is\nwaking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for,\nprotected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we were\nto ask, \"What has the baby done to deserve this?\" or, \"Have arrangements\nbeen made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?\" Our\nquestions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child was\nconceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love's excitement, a love\nthat has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents' love is\nunconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child\nor its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally,\nspontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after\nHis image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the\nLord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to\nearn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identity\nthrough the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents' love. It is a\nscientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if\nit survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has been\nheld and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the\nembrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the new\ngeneration will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in\nthe love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and\ngladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His\nlove. \"Satisfied.\" in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing\nbeing filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describe\nthe earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received\nenough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be\ndrenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is the\nlifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in our\ndeepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems\ndisappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling\nthat he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make\nsense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks this\nsatisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the\nemotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in\nreligious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding\nto the love of the living God. Only in knowing God's love will the rest of life\nmake sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again\nbecame the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find it\nfascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His\nlove. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one would\nthink he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by\nthe knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knew\nbetter. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won't\nfind it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to\nmanipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and\ngive us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyes\nand satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking God\nto make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses' prayer was partially\nanswered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which\nworked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in its\nfullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out the\nlove of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church,\nwe read of the Holy Spirit \"falling upon\" the believers. This is an ancient\nexpression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used in\nLuke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and \"falling on his\nneck and kissing him.\" The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest\nself and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your\nbeing. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes.\nMoses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization\nthat we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taught\nus to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in a\nstate of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance\nand love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive love\nwe cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the Holy\nSpirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness to\nthink on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jaded\nwith the doctrine of \"perform to be accepted.\" We begin to realize that He\nloves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challenge\neveryone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your\neyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may not\nfeel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed the\nother day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians kept\nbehind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rays\nwithout being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing\nthat we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according to\nMoses, \"joy and gladness all our days.\" Joy is the result of a life that is\nfunctioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might say\nthat joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. Man' s highest\nperformance is to rest in the love God has for him... the hum will be joy, and\nthe result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now\nhas in life. Stop wandering in the wilderness. Be satisfied with His love and,\nin joy, day by day, receive all His promised blessings.\n\n\n----- End Included Message -----\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 18 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: tgk@cs.toronto.edu (Todd Kelley)\nSubject: Re: Faith and Dogma\nOrganization: Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto\nLines: 56\n\n>In  <1r1mr8$eov@aurora.engr.LaTech.edu> ray@engr.LaTech.edu (Bill Ray)\n>wrote:\n>\n>Faith and dogma are inevitable.

But if you can contrive\nto control the action in dreams or do an OOBE, it seems like a morality applies.\n\nNow, there seem to be 3 alternatives:\n\n1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.  In this case no morality\napplies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene', that is, not trying\nto think about anything evil, or indulgining in overly sexy or violent\nthoughts.\n\n2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane')\nEvidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in\ncommon by more than one person.  A\nmark of objective fact is that >1 people report the same objective experience.\nIn this case, the same interpersonal morality/ethics applies in dreams and\nOOBEs as does in waking life.\n\n3) Like (2), but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have a\nreal existence, a different moral/ethics apply there, and no (or maybe \ndifferent) moral laws apply there.\n\nSo... There it is.  Is one of these cases the truth, or does anyone know\nof another alternative?  respond by post or email.\n\nthanks very much\n\n*dt*\n\n========================================================\n\n.\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 217 (TP-FN)"}, {"text": "From: KEVXU@cunyvm.bitnet\nSubject: Re: Christianity and repeated lives\nOrganization: City University of New York\nLines: 36\n\nWhile this is essentially a discussion of reincarnation in the context of\nChristianity Gerry Palo has made some comparisons to Asian religious\nbeliefs on this topic which have simplified the Asian idea of karma\nto the point of misrepresentation.\n\nThere are significant differences in the idea of karma among Hindus,\nJains, Buddhists (and even among the various Buddhist traditions.)\n\nTo refer to karma as a system of reward for past deeds is totally\nincorrect in the Buddhist and Jain traditions.

I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of\nactivity that could be named by \"fornication\" or \"theft\" or \"coveting\" or\n\"reviling\" or \"drunkenness\" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may\nor may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very\nfact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at\nall \"clear\" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest\nin MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,\nwith all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated\nChristian discussion of ALL these areas.\n\nHomosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I\nknow) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and\nchild molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly\n\"harmless\" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --\nthat would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter\nyou cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that\nyou want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]\n\n\t\"'I am free to do anything,' you say.  Yes, but not everything\n\tis for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one\n\twill not let anything make free with me.\"  [1 Cor. 6:12]\n\nWhich is a restatement that we must have no other \"god\" before God.  A\ncommandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some\npeople are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.\nIt is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary\nargument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such\nbehavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers.\n\nI won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.\nFundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your\nassumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of\nlaws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of\nwhich Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine\nthem.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are \"moral\" and\nwhich ones are \"ritual.\"  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology\ncourse should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories\nin an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).\nAnd I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus\nfrom the \"ritual law\" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.\n\nI'm dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this\nmatter) about how \"repulsive\" and \"unnatural\" our acts are -- and what\ndo they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of\narbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating\ninsects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you\nsay that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part\nof the ritual law?\n\nFor those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\nbe \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\nit is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\ndetermine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the\nwhole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: \"No doubt I am free to do anything.\"\nBut Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,\nthe Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go\nthrough Leviticus and decide each \"command\" there on that basis, then\nyour own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this\ncontext, it is remarkably offensive to say:\n\n>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the\n>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.\n\nWell, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the\none that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously\n(though one can always find jokers) in \"defense\" of bestiality.  It is\nabsolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\nraise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\nadult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\nthan the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you\nare being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the\nworld.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not\nmine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in\nour culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing\nus as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means\nyou can think of to do so.\n\nJesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,\nthe central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to\nlove one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-\nians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get\nin return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.\n\nChristians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every\ncorner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same\nold verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never\neven read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with\nthe vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\nmanage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great\nemotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even\ntaking the trouble to find out what it is.\n\nSuch behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.\nWHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to\ncondemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN\nto BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?\nGod forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or\ncondemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in\ninsisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are\nSO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.\n\nWhy, for God's sake?\n\n\t\"For God did not send the Son into the world\n\tto condemn the world,\n\tbut that the world might be saved through him.\n\tWhoever believes in him is not condemned,\n\tbut whoever does not believe has already been condemned\n\tfor refusing to believe in the name of God's only Son.\n\tNow the judgment is this:\n\tthe light has come into the world,\n\tbut men have preferred darkness to light\n\tbecause their deeds were evil.\n\tFor everyone who practices wickedness\n\thates the light,\n\tand does not come near the light\n\tfor fear his deeds will be exposed.\n\tBut he who acts in truth\n\tcomes into the light,\n\tso that it may be sh0own\n\tthat his deeds are done in God.\"\tJohn 3:17-21\n\nFor long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from\nevil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and\nrejected.

The verses in question are Hosea\n2:5,7 & 10; Jeremiah 4:30, 22:20 & 22; Lamentations 1:19; and Ezekiel\n16:33, 36 &37 and 23:5, 9 & 22.\n\n\t[ Hosea seems to have originated this usage, which Jeremiah and\n\t  Ezekiel picked up;  Lamentations is dependent on, though not\n\t  likely written by, Jeremiah. ]\n\nThe \"erotic\" meaning (in its allegorical use, not at all literally) is\nevident.  So too in English, unless you complement it with a phrase like\n\"of the arts\" the word \"lover\" is going to have an overtone of sexual\nrelationship.  There is no surprise here, but it is worthwhile to see\nthat standard Greek usage *does* show up in the translations from the\nHebrew! :-)\n\nMore interestingly, and some confirmation of my guess that later Koine\nusage avoided the verb _erao:_ because of its homonymy to _ero:_ (say),\n_eromai_ (ask), there is an error in Codex Vaticanus (normally, a very\nvaluable witness) where a form of _erao:_ is used in a completely absurd\ncontext -- 2 Samuel 20:18, where the  meaning *must* be \"say.\"\n\nIn addition to the above (and the uses I have already mentioned in Proverbs),\nEsther 2:17 uses the verb in its most natural application, \n\n\tkai e:rasthe\" ho basileus Esthe:r  --  and the King loved Esther\n\nand, rather more interestingly, 1 Samuel 19:2 supplies a modest degree of\nsupport to the gay appraisal of the relationship of David and Jonathan:\n\n\tkai Io:nathan huios Saoul e:[i]reito ton Dauid sphodra\n\t-- and Jonathan, Saul's son, loved David intensely\n\n\t[ I'm using the bracketed [i] for io:ta subscript, which I\n\t  don't yet have a reasonable ASCII convention for. ]\n\n(The relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about\nthe \"historical\" facts, but just that a quasi-official translation of\nthe Hebrew text in the Hellenistic period makes no bones about using the\n\"erotic\" verb in this context.

Unfortunately\nthere are a number of possible definitions.  Starting from the \nbroadest, commonly used definitions are:\n\n  a historical definition\n  people who accept Christ as Lord and savior\n  a broad doctrinal definition\n  narrow doctrinal definitions\n\n1) By a historical definition I mean the sort of definition a secular\nhistorian would likely use.  This would include any group that\ndeveloped out of the Christian church, and continues within the same\nbroad culture.  E.g. some Unitarians would fail just about any\ndoctrinal test you could come up with.  Yet it's clear that that group\ndeveloped from Christianity, and people from very different\nbackgrounds (e.g. Hindus) would likely see them as part of\nChristianity.  This is not a definition most Christians like, but it's\nrelevant in some political and ethnic contexts.\n\n2) Accepting Christ as Lord and savior is a test used by many\nChristian groups for membership, e.g. the Southern Baptists and\nPresbyterian Church (USA).  I would qualify it by saying that what\nmost people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to Christ, so that\nsomeone who accepted Christ as one of many gods would not fit.  It's\nan attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not based\non technical doctrine.  By this definition, groups such as Arians\nwould be viewed as heretical Christians, but still Christians.  In the\nmodern context this would include Mormons, JW's, and \"oneness\nPentecostals\".  They would be viewed as heretical Christians, but\nstill Christian.  In practice I believe just about everyone who falls\ninto this category would accept the Apostle's Creed.\n\n3) The next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition,\nwhich includes all of the major strands of Christianity, but excludes\ngroups that are felt to be outside \"historic Christianity.\"  This is\nof course a slippery enterprise, since Catholics could argue that\nProtestants are outside historic Christianity, etc.  But I think the\nmost commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the\nNicene Creed and the Formula of Chalcedon.  The attempt is to\ncharacterize doctrines that all major strands of Christianity agree\nare key.  Obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement.  A\nMormon will regard the LDS church as a major strand, and thus will not\nwant to include anything that contradicts their beliefs.  But I think\nthis definition would have fairly broad acceptance.\n\n4) Finally, some people use definitions that I would say are limited\nto a specific Christian tradition.  E.g. some evangelicals only\nconsider someone Christian if he has had an evangelical-style\nconversion experience, and some I've even heard of groups that limit\nit to their specific church.\n\nI think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used.\nA lot is going to depend upon the purpose you're using it for.  If\nyou're using it descriptively, e.g. in history or anthropology, you'll\nprobably use definition 1 or 2.  If you're using it normatively, i.e.\nto say what you believe the Christian message is, you'll probably use\na definition like 3 or even 4.\n\n--clh]\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 8 (TP)"}, {"text": "From: nichael@bbn.com (Nichael Cramer)\nSubject: Re: Variants in the NT Text (cont.)\nReply-To: ncramer@bbn.com\nOrganization: BBN, Interzone Office\nLines: 75\n\nFrom: db7n+@andrew.cmu.edu (D.

(I can supply the reference if anyone's interested.)\n\n5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.  So if\nyou're interested in examining the differences in the long recension\nan excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in:\n   \"A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT\", Bruce Metzger (United Bible\n   Society, 1971).\n\nMetzger's book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of\nthe Greek NT.  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went\nbehind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in\nthe UBS3.  Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are\nincluded in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts).\n\nIn particular in the introduction to the section on Acts Metzger writes:\n   \"[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full\n   report (with an English translation) of the several additions and\n   other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ...\n   Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the\n   text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the\n   evidence that supports the divergent readings.\" (p 272).\n\n>I understand that one of the early codexes, Vaticanus and Siniaticus has\n>this version of Acts.

The longer version to which you refer is\nusually called the \"Western\" version and its main witness is the Codex\nBezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).\n\n7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark's edition\n(mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the\ntext edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains\n18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.\n\n8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations\nin the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.

Dr. James DeYoung; #3]\n\nR. Scroggs\n\n     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and\nsuggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a\n\"Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic\nterminology.\"  The term is derived from Lev 18\"22 & 20:13 where the LXX\njuxtaposes the two words arsenos (\"male\") and koiten (\"bed\"), and represents\nthe Hebrew miskab zabar (\"lying with a male\").   Yet he believes that Paul did\nnot originate the term, but borrowed it from \"circles of Hellenistic Jews\nacquainted with rabbinic discussions\" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid\n\"contact with the usual Greek terminology\" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs\nobserves, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions\nof pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to\nnative-speaking Greeks (108).\n\n     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the\nobject of the second part, thus differing from Boswell's \"learned discussion\"\n(107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of \"one who lies with a\nmale\" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9),\nwhich Scroggs interprets as \"the effeminate call-boy,\" arsenokoitai is the\nactive partner \"who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress' or who hires him on\noccasion to satisfy his sexual desires\" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not\nrefer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic\nmodel of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he\naffirms (109).\n     This is Scrogg's interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The\ncombination of pornoi (\"fornicators\"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai (\"slave\ndealers\") refers to \"male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave\ndealers [who procure them]\" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of\npederasty \"which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual\npurposes, and the use of these boys by adult males\" (121).  Even \"serious\nminded pagan authors\" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these\ninstances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently\ngeneral condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. \nConsequently Paul \"Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind\" (122).\nWe cannot know what Paul would have said about the \"contemporary model of\nadult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships\" (122).\n\n     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical\nconcerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of\nvices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and\nfunction of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any\nrelationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually\nnonexistent.  He concludes that Paul \"does not care about any specific item in\nthe lists\" (104). \n\n     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary\nphenomenon of a \"catalogue of vices,\"  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are\n\"irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today\" (129).  The \"model\nin today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model\nattacked by the NT\" that \"Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not\nrelevant to today's debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational\ndiscussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify\nrefusal of ordination. . . \" (127).\n\n      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI\n\nD. Wright\n\n     In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have\ncome under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell's\nview is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out\nseveral shortcomings of Boswell's treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults\nBoswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev\n18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the \"Apostolic\nConstitutions,\"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). \nBoswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term\nderives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This\nis significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell's\nclaim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the\ngender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean \"a male who sleeps with\na male,\" making arseno- the object.\n\n     Wright also faults Boswell's claims regarding linguistic features of the\nterm, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that\ncompounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it\nas an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely\none of dialectical diversity: \"No semantic import attaches to the difference\nbetween the two forms\" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which\nthe second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its\nobject and where \"the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its\ngender\" (132). \n\n     It is with Boswell's treatment of the early church fathers that Wright\ntakes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. \nFor example, Aristides' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis,\nandrobaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male\nhomosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell's discussion.  Boswell fails to cite\nHippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the\nSyriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to\nthe Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34). \n\n     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in\nparallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the\ndominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this\nparallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia (\"adultery\"), porneia\n(\"fornication\"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris\n(136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the\nTen Commandments as \"You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis (\"you shall not commit\nadultery\"), ou paidophthoreseis (\"you shall not practice homosexuality with\nboys\"), you shall not steal. . .\" (150 n. 43).\n\n     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein (\"commit homosexuality\") exists in the\nSibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was\ncoined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by\nOr.Sib., book 2 (137-38).\n\n     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew\nupon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John\nthe Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of\nhomosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.\n\n     Wright next replies to Boswell's contention that the term would not be\nabsent \"from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted\n(140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to\nthe first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used\ndozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g.\nDidache) show no acquaintance with Paul's letters or deliberately avoid citing\nScripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). \n\n     Boswell's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright's attention\n(141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom,\nomitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a\nlong uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom\n1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom's infrequent use of the term.  Wright\nobserves that Boswell has \"signally failed to demonstrate any us of\narsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual\nactivity\" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature\nand the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly\nspecified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world. \n\n     Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim\nand I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning\n\"homosexual\" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of\nthe word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell's limited\nconclusion based on them.\n\n     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the\ncatalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed\nin late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of\nhomosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the\npart of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into\nbeing under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke \"generally of\nmale activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual\nengagement with paides\" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were\ninterchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).\n\n     In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning\nhomosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and\nothers who limit the term to \"active male prostitutes\" or pederasty are without\nsignificant support from linguistic and historical studies.  \n\n[Next: the questioning of Wrights position by William Peterson.  After that, we\nget into the \"good\" stuff of historical & linguistic studies.  THis will\ninclude \"Symposium\" by Plato.  If there is any doubt as to the modern\nunderstanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time of\nPaul, this will certainly clear things up.  Also we will review Paul's use of\nLev18-20 in the NT and how, as for him, 1) the Law was fulfilled, but not done\naway with, 2) Lev 18-20 was the universal and the following chapters the\ngeneral.  Those who put forth that the OT no longer holds true today in our\nculture, should stick around for this one.]\n___________________________\n13 R.

But this is doubtful.  See the more cautious words of P.\nZaas, \"I Cor 6.9ff: Was Homosexuality Condoned in the Corinthian Church? SBLASP\n17 (1979):205-12.  He observes that the words moixai, malakoi, and arsenokoitai\nwere part of Jewish anti-Gentile polemic.  Yet Paul's wors at the end of the\nvice list, \"and such were some of you,\" indicate that \"Paul is addressing real\nor potential abuses of his ethical message, not citing primitive tradition by\nrote\" (210).  Wright disputes Zaas' attempt to associate the term with idolatry\n(147).\n15  On Boswell's treatment of Rom 1:26-7, the article by R.B.

See  J.B.\nDeYoung, \"A Critique of Prohomosexual Interpretations of the OT Apocrypha and\nPseudepigrapha,\" BSac 146/588 (1990):437-53.\n20   In light of the claim made by Boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitai\npoints to a meaning lacking homosexual significance, Wright asks pertinently\n\"why neither Philo nor Josephus use  paidofthoria, nor Josephus paiderastia,\nand why . . Clement did not use the latter and Chrysostom the former?\"  (152 n.\n71)  In a more recent article, \"Homosexuality: The Relevance of the Bible,\" EvQ\n61 (1989):291-300, Wright reiterates these same points.

Goggin)\nSubject: Dreams and out of body incidents\nLines: 38\n\nhey folks,\n\nI'm fairly new to these groups, tho' some have heard from me before.\n\nI'd like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a\nlot:  What morals/ethics apply to dreams and out-of-body incidents?\nIn normal dreams, you can't control anything, so obviously\nyou aren't morally responsible for your actions.  But if you can contrive\nto control the action in dreams or do an OOBE, it seems like a morality applies.\n\nNow, there seem to be 3 alternatives:\n\n1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.  In this case no morality\napplies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene', that is, not trying\nto think about anything evil, or indulgining in overly sexy or violent\nthoughts.\n\n2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane')\nEvidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in\ncommon by more than one person.  A\nmark of objective fact is that >1 people report the same objective experience.\nIn this case, the same interpersonal morality/ethics applies in dreams and\nOOBEs as does in waking life.\n\n3) Like (2), but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have a\nreal existence, a different moral/ethics apply there, and no (or maybe \ndifferent) moral laws apply there.\n\nSo... There it is.  Is one of these cases the truth, or does anyone know\nof another alternative?  respond by post or email.\n\nthanks very much\n\n*dt*\n\n========================================================\n\n.\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 217 (FN)"}, {"text": "From: acooper@mac.cc.macalstr.edu (Turin Turambar, ME Department of Utter Misery)\nSubject: STRONG & weak Atheism\nOrganization: Macalester College\nLines: 14\n\nDid that FAQ ever got modified to re-define strong atheists as not those who\nassert the nonexistence of God, but as those who assert that they BELIEVE in \nthe nonexistence of God?

Hislop's scholarship was\naccepted by the Bristish Oriental Institute which, at the time, was the premere\nInstitute for Oriental studies.  As I've stated over and over,  I've checked\nout about 25% of his references (most are now out of print or in private\nlibraries) and the likes of Wilkerson and Layard hold their own merit.  THey\ntoo came to the same conclusions and if you will trouble yourself, you will\nfind that their knowledge of the mysteries have yet to be surpassed.  Both were\nhighly honored by the British Oriental Museum.  Wilkerson is known as one of\nthe leading archeologist in the history of Egyptiology and Layard is still\nbeing refered two after 200 yrs of archeology in the Mesopotamian regions.  He\nwas recently refered to in a TIME article on Babylonian archeology.  \n\nPhony scholarship is when you review their references and find that they have\nmisquoted or misrepresented the conclusions.  Hislop did not.  His conclusions\ndo not tickle the ears, that much is self evident.  But to assert that his\nconclusions are \"spurious\" is without merit.  He gave references to all his\nconclusions and as I have stated, for the last 25 years I have used his\nconclusions in debates at RC seminaries and brotherhoods, not to mention the\nindividual priests and bishops that I have talked to one on one.  No counter to\nHislops scholarship was made.  The only rebuttals were against his conclusions\nbecause they do totally undermined the claims of the RCC. He was showing that\nthe intitution of the RCC was based on the mysteries (which others have shown\neven to this day in various articles and topics).  THe tongues movement in\nCorinth was a direct result of the mysteries entering into the church.  If it\nwas so in Corinth, why could they not have an influence in Rome, the city of\nseven hills?\n\nAlso, you do not have to listen to his conclusions, you can draw your own\nconclusions by looking at the customs, artifacts, the cerimonial dress, the\ndocrine of purgatory, etc from the vantage of the mysteries.  You don't even\nhave to be a believer to see the parallels.  Just one example.  THe mitre. \nWhere did it come from?  Why is it shaped the way it is?  What are the two\ntails that hang down the back represent?  Was this an ancient  head dress from\nan earlier culture and why was it in Rome at the time of the beginnings of the\nchurch of the State of Rome?  Does it have pagan history behind it, and if so,\nwhy did the RCC chose regardless?\n\nAny lay person of middle eastern religion can answer these questions.  Even the\nscriptures themselves refer to it.  All Hislop did was collect the information\nfrom all the various sources and put them in one binding.  There is no lack of\nscholorship in that.\n\nPlease tell me why you discredit this man by your accusation, yet present no\nevidence supporting it.  \n\n--Rex\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 249 (FN)"}, {"text": "From: frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O'Dwyer)\nSubject: Re: islamic genocide\nOrganization: Siemens-Nixdorf AG\nLines: 49\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: d012s658.ap.mchp.sni.de\n\nIn article <1r2gi8$6e1@fido.asd.sgi.com> livesey@solntze.wpd.sgi.com (Jon Livesey) writes:\n#In article <1qu485$58o@horus.ap.mchp.sni.de>, frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O'Dwyer) writes:\n#|> In article <1qkovl$k@fido.asd.sgi.com> livesey@solntze.wpd.sgi.com (Jon Livesey) writes:\n#|> #\n#|> #False dichotomy.

A generation\nbefore the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh,\ngateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather\nthan God's way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which would\nhave given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored their\ndecision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the\nland of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision-\nmakers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and\ndestined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the\ntime they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderers\nhad been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with a\nsigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they\nwere going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence.\nWhatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached\nbones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression of\nhopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nation\nat Kadesh and had God' s promise of one day entering the land. The\nforty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, those\nwho were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the\ninheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Moses\nprays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over.\nAll these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining\npeople through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden.\nHis was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but\nhe also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem was\nthat they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. \"Who is your\nGod?\" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. When\nAaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or young\nbull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bull\nwho had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt's gods as He led\nIsrael to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles grow\nthin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and water\ngushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the\nGod of Almightiness becomes \"ho-hum --What' s next on the miracle menu?\"\nAnd a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He might\nbe all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a right\nto do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these people\nhad known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men's lives had hung\non the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believed\nGod could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIM\nand, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, His\nacts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From the\nday of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God.\nAt Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. He\nhad seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. This\nrequest was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God's glorious\nPerson. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and\nlovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word \"lovingkindness\" is not to be\nunderstood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationship\narising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as the\nlove that says, \"I will never leave you nor forsake you.\" Lovingkindness is as\ntenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its\nheels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based on\nfeelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and,\ntherefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God's love is not an emotion\nthat wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our\nhighest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. God\ndoes not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings\nof love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with\nus! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Him\nto reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- not\nbecause of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committed\nto us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He will\nnot let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us--\nbut a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It is\nsaying to the recipient, \"For as long as we shall live, I am for you.\"  The God\nwho has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--in\nHis coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who is\nlovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will never\nleave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him as\nlove; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeing\nmiracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in the\nheart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power.\nMoses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had for\nthese people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, they\ncould not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born out\nof knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One who\ngives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is to\nmiss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  If\nman is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on\nknowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues from\nlove demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years of\nmeaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to\nknow the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and the\npossibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. The\nlanguage Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its\nmother's love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It is\nwaking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for,\nprotected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we were\nto ask, \"What has the baby done to deserve this?\" or, \"Have arrangements\nbeen made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?\" Our\nquestions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child was\nconceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love's excitement, a love\nthat has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents' love is\nunconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child\nor its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally,\nspontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after\nHis image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the\nLord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to\nearn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identity\nthrough the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents' love. It is a\nscientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if\nit survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has been\nheld and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the\nembrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the new\ngeneration will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in\nthe love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and\ngladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His\nlove. \"Satisfied.\" in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing\nbeing filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describe\nthe earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received\nenough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be\ndrenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is the\nlifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in our\ndeepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems\ndisappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling\nthat he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make\nsense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks this\nsatisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the\nemotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in\nreligious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding\nto the love of the living God. Only in knowing God's love will the rest of life\nmake sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again\nbecame the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find it\nfascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His\nlove. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one would\nthink he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by\nthe knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knew\nbetter. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won't\nfind it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to\nmanipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and\ngive us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyes\nand satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking God\nto make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses' prayer was partially\nanswered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which\nworked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in its\nfullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out the\nlove of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church,\nwe read of the Holy Spirit \"falling upon\" the believers. This is an ancient\nexpression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used in\nLuke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and \"falling on his\nneck and kissing him.\" The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest\nself and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your\nbeing. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes.\nMoses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization\nthat we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taught\nus to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in a\nstate of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance\nand love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive love\nwe cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the Holy\nSpirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness to\nthink on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jaded\nwith the doctrine of \"perform to be accepted.\" We begin to realize that He\nloves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challenge\neveryone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your\neyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may not\nfeel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed the\nother day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians kept\nbehind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rays\nwithout being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing\nthat we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according to\nMoses, \"joy and gladness all our days.\" Joy is the result of a life that is\nfunctioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might say\nthat joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. Man' s highest\nperformance is to rest in the love God has for him... the hum will be joy, and\nthe result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now\nhas in life. Stop wandering in the wilderness. Be satisfied with His love and,\nin joy, day by day, receive all His promised blessings.\n\n\n----- End Included Message -----\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 18 (TP)"}, {"text": "From: tomault+@cs.cmu.edu (Thomas Galen Ault)\nSubject: Re: Why do people become atheists?\nOrganization: School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon\nLines: 70\n\nIn article <May.5.02.50.42.1993.28665@athos.rutgers.edu> Fil.Sapienza@med.umich.edu (Fil Sapienza) writes:\n>I am interested in finding out why people become\n>atheists after having believed in some god/God.\n>In conversing with them on other groups, I've\n>often sensed anger or hostility.

Thus, some atheism might result from \n>broken-ness.\n\nI'd like to field this one, if I may.  Although I am a believer in and follower\nof Christ, my experiences with religion haven't been all that positive.  In\nfact, there was one point in my life when, for about three days, I simply\n_couldn't_ believe in the existence of God.  Anyway, when I look back upon the\ntroubles I've had, they seem to fall into two categories -- impulses to\nunbelief that resulted from logical contradictions, and impulses to unbelief\nthat resulted from frustration with God.\n\nThe first category doesn't occur to me much anymore, as I have worked through\nmost of the arguments for the non-existence of God.  But way back when, these\nwould cause me some problems, and I would have to struggle with my faith to\ncontinue to believe.  I can see where others less stubborn than I (and I do\nmean stubborn.  Stubborness has often been the only thing standing between\nme an atheism from time to time) would fail.\n\nThe second category arises out of some long-term personal difficulties and\nthe struggle to live my life as God would have me live it WITHOUT living my \nlife as others would tell me how God would have me live it.  A good example of\nthis is my struggle with the more radical Christians I meet.  I am not, nor\nhave I ever been, \"on fire for Chirst,\" and I don't think I ever want to be.\nNevertheless, I am not \"lukewarm\" about my faith, so I don't really\nfit in with the mainstream either.  Quite naturally, I feel a lot of anxiety\nabout my dislocation within Christian society, and it can lead to a lot of\ninternal tension, when I want to do what I _know_ is right,\nbut when another part of me believes that what I want to do is wrong because\nall the other Christians think so to.  Quite naturally, this tension has a\ndestructive effect on my relationship with God, and during all of this internal\nstrife, there's atheism sitting there like the promised land -- no rules, no\nresponsibilities, no need to live up to anyone's expectations but my own.\nComplete freedom.  Of course, it's all an illusion, but nevertheless, it's a\nvery appealing illusion, especially when the so-called \"people of God\" are\nbehaving like total twits.  I can easily understand why someone would go\nthat route, and would be hostile to ever coming back.\n\nIMHO, many of the former-Christians-turned-atheists-who-are-now-actively-\nhostile-to-Christianity are so because their experience with Christ and God\nwasn't a very peaceful one, but one of mind-control and \"shut-up-and-do-what-\nyou're-told-because-we-know-what's-best-for-you-because-it's-God's-will-and-\nyou're-to-young-to-know-what-God's-will-is-yet\" courtesy of some of Christ's\nmore overzealous followers.  \n\nA final reason why people become atheists is because Christians do not have a\nvery good reputation right now.  One of the things that attracted people to\nChristianity in the ancient days was the love that Christians obviously had\nfor one another and the world around them.  Unlike the rest of the world,\nChristian communities actively cared for their poor, and the Christian rich\ndid not trod on the backs of their poorer brothers, but bent down to help\nthem.  Christians were known for living exemplary lives, even if they were\nthought to be traitors to the state because they wouldn't sacrifice to the\nemporer.  Nowadays, courtesy of the media and some Christian leaders who lost\nChrist on their way to power, people see Christians as sexually-repressed\nhippocritical busibodies who want to remake society into a facist version of \ntheir own moral view.\n\nThere are a lot more reasons why people become atheists, but I don't have time\nto go into them right now.\n\n\n\nTom Ault\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 417 (FN)"}, {"text": "From: frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O'Dwyer)\nSubject: Re: Societal basis for morality\nOrganization: Siemens-Nixdorf AG\nLines: 49\nNNTP-Posting-Host: d012s658.ap.mchp.sni.de\n\nIn article <1993Apr20.004119.6119@cnsvax.uwec.edu> nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu (David Nye) writes:\n\nYou asked me to look over here, but I was on my way back anyway :-)\n\n#[reply to cobb@alexia.lis.uiuc.edu (Mike Cobb)]\n# \n#>If morals come from what is societally accepted, why follow that?

M. Wilson\n   (London, 1923).\n\n2] Another work that might be useful is:\n   \"The Acts of the Apostles, a Critical Edition with Introduction and\n   Notes on Selected Passages\", Albert C. Clark (Oxford, 1933;\n   reprinted 1970).\n\n(This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the\ntext in Codex Bezae is the more authentic.  I don't know if it\nactually contains an english translation or not.)\n\n3] Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is:\n   \"The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in\n   Acts\", Eldon J Epp (Cambridge, 1966).\n\n4] The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the\nearly '80s.  (I can supply the reference if anyone's interested.)\n\n5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.  So if\nyou're interested in examining the differences in the long recension\nan excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in:\n   \"A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT\", Bruce Metzger (United Bible\n   Society, 1971).\n\nMetzger's book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of\nthe Greek NT.  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went\nbehind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in\nthe UBS3.  Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are\nincluded in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts).\n\nIn particular in the introduction to the section on Acts Metzger writes:\n   \"[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full\n   report (with an English translation) of the several additions and\n   other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ...\n   Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the\n   text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the\n   evidence that supports the divergent readings.\" (p 272).\n\n>I understand that one of the early codexes, Vaticanus and Siniaticus has\n>this version of Acts.  It would be interesting to know what the\n>differences are between the long and the short forms.\n\n6] Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have (including the\nones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter\n(or Alexandrian) version.  The longer version to which you refer is\nusually called the \"Western\" version and its main witness is the Codex\nBezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).\n\n7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark's edition\n(mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the\ntext edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains\n18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.\n\n8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations\nin the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The main\ndifference seems to \"expansion\" of detail in the Western text (or, if\nyou prefer \"contractions\" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seems\nto be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specific\ncases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.\n\n9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the\nmore authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anything\napproaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents\npurely the \"authentic\" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be\nexamined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the\nAlexandrian text is the \"better\" more often than not.\n\nN\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 506 (FN)"}, {"text": "From:  (Rashid)\nSubject: Re: Yet more Rushdie [Re: ISLAMIC LAW]\nNntp-Posting-Host: nstlm66\nOrganization: NH\nLines: 19\n\nIn article <116171@bu.edu>, jaeger@buphy.bu.edu (Gregg Jaeger) wrote:\n> \nI have already made the clear claim that\n> Khomeini advocates views which are in contradition with the Qur'an\n> and have given my arguments for this.

Bailey\n\n     D.S. Bailey was perhaps the trailblazer of new assessments of the meaning\nof arsenokoitai.  He takes the term in I Cor 6:9 as denoting males who actively\nengage in homosexual acts, in contrast to malakoi (\"effeminate\"), those who\nengage passively in such acts.*4   However, he insists that Paul knew nothing\nof \"inversion as an inherited trait, or an inherent condition due to\npsychological or glandular causes, and consequently regards all homosexual\npractice as evidence of perversion\" (38).  Hence Bailey limits the term's\nreference in Paul's works to acts alone and laments modern translations of the\nterm as \"homosexuals.\"  Bailey wants to distinguish between \"the homosexual\n*condition* (which is morally neutral) and homosexual *practices*\" [italics in\nsource].  Paul is precise in his terminology and Moffatt's translation\n\"sodomites\" best represents Paul's meaning in Bailey's judgment (39).  Bailey\nclearly denies that the homosexual condition was known by biblical writers.\n\nJ. Boswell\n\n     The most influential study of arsenokoitai among contemporary authors is\nthat of John Boswell.*5    Whereas the usual translation*6  of this term gives\nit either explicitly or implicitly an active sense, Boswell gives it a passive\nsense.\n\n      In an extended discussion of the term (341-53), he cites \"linguistic\nevidence and common sense\" to support his conclusion that the word means \"male\nsexual agents, i.e. active male prostitutes.\"  His argument is that the arseno-\npart of the word is adjectival, not the object of the koitai which refers to\nbase sexual activity.  Hence the term, according to Boswell, designates a male\nsexual person or male prostitute.  He acknowledges, however, that most\ninterpret the composite term as active, meaning \"those who sleep with, make\ntheir bed with, men.\"  Boswell bases his interpretation on linguistics and the\nhistorical setting.  He argues that in some compounds, such as paidomathes\n(\"child learner\"), the paido- is the subject of manthano, and in others, such\nas paidoporos (\"through which a child passes\"), the paido- is neither subject\nnor object but simply a modifier without verbal significance.  His point is\nthat each compound must be individually analyzed for its meaning.  More\ndirectly, he maintains that compounds with the Attic form arreno- employ it\nobjectively while those with the Hellenistic arseno- use it as an adjective\n(343).  Yet he admits exceptions to this distinction regarding arreno-.\n\n     Boswell next appeals to the Latin of the time, namely drauci or exoleti. \nThese were male prostitutes having men or women as their objects.  The Greek\narsenokoitai is the equivalent of the Latin drauci;  the corresponding passive\nwould be parakoitai (\"one who lies beside\"), Boswell affirms.  He claims that\narsenokoitai was the \"most explicit word available to Paul for a male\nprostitute,\" since by Paul's time the Attic words pornos (\"fornicator\") and\nporneuon (\"one committing fornication\"), found also in the LXX, had been\nadopted \"to refer to men who resorted to female prostitutes or simply committed\nfornication.\"*7\n\n     In the absence of the term from pagan writers such as Herodotus, Plato,\nAristotle, and Plutarch, and from the Jewish writers Philo and Josephus,\nBoswell finds even more convincing evidence for his affirmation that\narsenokoitai \"did not connote 'homosexual' or even 'sodomite' in the time of\nPaul\" (346).*8   He also demonstrates its absence in Pseudo-Lucian, Sextus\nEmpiricus, and Libanius.  He subsequently finds it lacking in \"all discussions\nof homosexual relation\" (346)*9  among Christian sources in Greek, including\nthe Didache, Tatian, Justin Martyr, Eusebius,*10    Clement of Alexandria,\nGregory of Nyssa, and John Chrysostom.  Chrysostom is singled out for his\nomission as \"final proof\" that the word could not mean homosexuality.*11 \n\n     Boswell next appeals to the omission of the texts of I Cor and I Tim from\ndiscussions of homosexuality among Latin church fathers (348).*12   Cited are\nTertullian, Arnobius, Lactantius, and Augustine.  The last named uses\n\"circumlocutions.\"  Other Latin writers include Ausonius, Cyprian, and Minucius\nFelix.  The term is also lacking in state and in church legislation.  By the\nsixth century the term became confused and was applied to a variety of sexual\nactivities from child molesting to anal intercourse between a husband and wife\n(353).\n\n     Having surveyed the sources, Boswell concludes, \n\n   There is no reason to believe that either arsenokoitai or malakoi connoted\n   homosexuality in the time of Paul or for centuries thereafter, and every\nreason\n   to suppose that, whatever they came to mean, they were not determinative of\n   Christian opinion on the morality of homosexual acts (353).\n\nIt is clear throughout that Boswell defines arsenokoitai to refer to male\nprostitutes.  He even goes so far as to conclude that Paul would probably not\ndisapprove of \"gay inclination,\"  \"gay relationships,\"  \"enduring love between\npersons of the same gender,\" or \"same-sex eroticism\"  (112, 166-17).\n\n\n________________________________________________________\n4.

STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC\n\n\tYour natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to\npanic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get right\nwith God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your \nonly chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the \nTribulation.  \"But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be \nsaved.\" - Matthew 24:13\n\nII. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION\n\n\tThe Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of\nthe rapture until Christ's second coming.  Also know as \"the time of Jacob's\n(Israel's) trouble\" (Jere 30:7) and \"Daniel's Seventieth Week\" (Dan 9), this \nperiod will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.\n\nIII. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM\n\n\tSoon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community \n(the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will\nbe tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable \npossession during the Tribulation.\n\nIV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tSince all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it\nis imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can\nquote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, \nRevelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to\nunfold before you.  \n\nV. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tPray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray \nand pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual \nstrength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the\nsake of Christ.  \n\nVI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED\nONES DIE AS MARTYRS\n\n\tAfter the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he\nwill institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell,\nor eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be\nuseless.  \"And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and \nslave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that\nno one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, \nor the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding\ncalculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number\nis 666\" - Revelation 13:16-18.  \n\tThe Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of \nhumanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed\nin the past, such as the Holocaust.\n[or maybe the crusades? -M]\nYou cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's\nrule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) \"...I saw\nunder the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and\nfor the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of \nthem: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, \nuntil both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be\nkilled as they were, was completed.\" Revelation 6:9, 11.\n\tHis targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image\nor take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ \"...And I saw the souls of \nthose who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of \nGod, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark\non their foreheads or on the hands.\" - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every\nform of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor\nwill he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, \ntorturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take\nthe mark.  \n\tIf you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,\nyou will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.\n[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]\nYou cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and\ngain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake\nof Fire.  \"...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his \nmark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of\nthe wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His \nindignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the \npresence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.\" -Revelation \n14:9-10 \n\n[and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to\nthe first 5,000 at the stadium --M] \n\nVII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL\n\n\tAlthough you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist's government\nuntil the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is \nimportant for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are\nextremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.\n\tThe first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or\nmountainous area, for the Antichrist's control will come last to the least\npopulated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay \nattuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.\n[\"As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep\ninto our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school\nclosings\" --M] \nStore water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without\nthe mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste\nfrom nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.\n[Get a good water filter. --M]\nBring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,\nbatteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to \nsurvive and live off the land as the pioneers did.\n\nVIII. TRUST NO ONE\n\t\n\tThere will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist's\ngovernment.  Be on the lookout.\n[Perot supporters take note --M]\n\nIX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST\n\n\tIt is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,\nfor he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will\nbring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel \n11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a\nhalf years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be \nphysically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and \npersonality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic\nexpert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which\nhe will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural \npower that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will\nbe deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.\n[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]\n\tThe antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who\nwill make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  \nAll who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and\na half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.\n\nX. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!\n\n\tThe seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of\nChrist.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you \nwill be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  \n\tStart reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of \nyour sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take\nthe mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or\nremain saved, but this time you will have to be \"faithful unto death.\"\n\n\tMay God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!\n\n******************************************************************************\nMike Cluff\t\t\t\t*  \"Christianity is Stupid.\nv22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms\t*   Give up.\" -Negativland\nUB Language Perception Laboratory\t*  \n******************************************************************************\n\n\n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\ \n\nBob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM \n\nThey said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,\nand sank Manhattan out at sea.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n", "true_class": 0, "title": "ID 94 (FP-TN)"}, {"text": "From: scharle@lukasiewicz.cc.nd.edu (scharle)\nSubject: Re: Rawlins debunks creationism\nReply-To: scharle@lukasiewicz.cc.nd.edu (scharle)\nOrganization: Univ. of Notre Dame\nLines: 54\n\nIn article <30151@ursa.bear.com>, halat@pooh.bears (Jim Halat) writes:\n|> In article <C5snCL.J8o@usenet.ucs.indiana.edu>, adpeters@sunflower.bio.indiana.edu (Andy Peters) writes:\n|> \n|> >Evolution, as I have said before, is theory _and_ fact.

And such were \n>some of you...\"  I Cor. 6:9-11.\n\nThe moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_\nin this.  I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of\nactivity that could be named by \"fornication\" or \"theft\" or \"coveting\" or\n\"reviling\" or \"drunkenness\" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may\nor may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very\nfact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at\nall \"clear\" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest\nin MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,\nwith all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated\nChristian discussion of ALL these areas.\n\nHomosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I\nknow) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and\nchild molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly\n\"harmless\" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --\nthat would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter\nyou cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that\nyou want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]\n\n\t\"'I am free to do anything,' you say.  Yes, but not everything\n\tis for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one\n\twill not let anything make free with me.\"  [1 Cor. 6:12]\n\nWhich is a restatement that we must have no other \"god\" before God.  A\ncommandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some\npeople are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.\nIt is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary\nargument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such\nbehavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers.\n\nI won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.\nFundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your\nassumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of\nlaws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of\nwhich Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine\nthem.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are \"moral\" and\nwhich ones are \"ritual.\"  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology\ncourse should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories\nin an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).\nAnd I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus\nfrom the \"ritual law\" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.\n\nI'm dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this\nmatter) about how \"repulsive\" and \"unnatural\" our acts are -- and what\ndo they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of\narbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating\ninsects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you\nsay that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part\nof the ritual law?\n\nFor those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\nbe \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\nit is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\ndetermine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the\nwhole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: \"No doubt I am free to do anything.\"\nBut Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,\nthe Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go\nthrough Leviticus and decide each \"command\" there on that basis, then\nyour own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this\ncontext, it is remarkably offensive to say:\n\n>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the\n>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.\n\nWell, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the\none that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously\n(though one can always find jokers) in \"defense\" of bestiality.  It is\nabsolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\nraise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\nadult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\nthan the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you\nare being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the\nworld.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not\nmine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in\nour culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing\nus as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means\nyou can think of to do so.\n\nJesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,\nthe central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to\nlove one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-\nians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get\nin return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.\n\nChristians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every\ncorner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same\nold verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never\neven read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with\nthe vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\nmanage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great\nemotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even\ntaking the trouble to find out what it is.\n\nSuch behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.\nWHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to\ncondemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN\nto BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?\nGod forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or\ncondemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in\ninsisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are\nSO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.\n\nWhy, for God's sake?\n\n\t\"For God did not send the Son into the world\n\tto condemn the world,\n\tbut that the world might be saved through him.\n\tWhoever believes in him is not condemned,\n\tbut whoever does not believe has already been condemned\n\tfor refusing to believe in the name of God's only Son.\n\tNow the judgment is this:\n\tthe light has come into the world,\n\tbut men have preferred darkness to light\n\tbecause their deeds were evil.\n\tFor everyone who practices wickedness\n\thates the light,\n\tand does not come near the light\n\tfor fear his deeds will be exposed.\n\tBut he who acts in truth\n\tcomes into the light,\n\tso that it may be sh0own\n\tthat his deeds are done in God.\"\tJohn 3:17-21\n\nFor long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from\nevil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and\nrejected.

Blessed are those whose spirits\nhave been crushed by the self-righteous; they shall be justified.\n\nHowever, we have seen the Truth, and the Truth is the light of humanity;\nand we now know that it is not WE who fear the light, but our enemies who\nfear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadow\nit with the darkness of false witness against us.\n-- \nMichael L.

Unfortunately\nthere are a number of possible definitions.  Starting from the \nbroadest, commonly used definitions are:\n\n  a historical definition\n  people who accept Christ as Lord and savior\n  a broad doctrinal definition\n  narrow doctrinal definitions\n\n1) By a historical definition I mean the sort of definition a secular\nhistorian would likely use.  This would include any group that\ndeveloped out of the Christian church, and continues within the same\nbroad culture.  E.g. some Unitarians would fail just about any\ndoctrinal test you could come up with.  Yet it's clear that that group\ndeveloped from Christianity, and people from very different\nbackgrounds (e.g. Hindus) would likely see them as part of\nChristianity.  This is not a definition most Christians like, but it's\nrelevant in some political and ethnic contexts.\n\n2) Accepting Christ as Lord and savior is a test used by many\nChristian groups for membership, e.g. the Southern Baptists and\nPresbyterian Church (USA).  I would qualify it by saying that what\nmost people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to Christ, so that\nsomeone who accepted Christ as one of many gods would not fit.  It's\nan attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not based\non technical doctrine.  By this definition, groups such as Arians\nwould be viewed as heretical Christians, but still Christians.  In the\nmodern context this would include Mormons, JW's, and \"oneness\nPentecostals\".  They would be viewed as heretical Christians, but\nstill Christian.  In practice I believe just about everyone who falls\ninto this category would accept the Apostle's Creed.\n\n3) The next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition,\nwhich includes all of the major strands of Christianity, but excludes\ngroups that are felt to be outside \"historic Christianity.\"  This is\nof course a slippery enterprise, since Catholics could argue that\nProtestants are outside historic Christianity, etc.  But I think the\nmost commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the\nNicene Creed and the Formula of Chalcedon.  The attempt is to\ncharacterize doctrines that all major strands of Christianity agree\nare key.  Obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement.  A\nMormon will regard the LDS church as a major strand, and thus will not\nwant to include anything that contradicts their beliefs.  But I think\nthis definition would have fairly broad acceptance.\n\n4) Finally, some people use definitions that I would say are limited\nto a specific Christian tradition.  E.g. some evangelicals only\nconsider someone Christian if he has had an evangelical-style\nconversion experience, and some I've even heard of groups that limit\nit to their specific church.\n\nI think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used.\nA lot is going to depend upon the purpose you're using it for.  If\nyou're using it descriptively, e.g. in history or anthropology, you'll\nprobably use definition 1 or 2.  If you're using it normatively, i.e.\nto say what you believe the Christian message is, you'll probably use\na definition like 3 or even 4.\n\n--clh]\n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 8 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: dekorte@dirac.scri.fsu.edu (Stephen L.

Your reasoning, as I see it, is very much along the\nlines of Roger Penrose, who claimed that mathematical 'insight' cannot\nbe algorithmic in his book _The emperor's new mind: Concerning\ncomputers, minds, and the laws of physics_. However, Penrose's\nclaim that he _has_ mathematical insight, or your similar claim\nthat wavefunctions collapse only when we consciously take a look,\ncould be just illusions.\n\nWe are obviouslu taking very different viewpoints - I try to ponder\non the problem of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective,\nrealising that it might not be anything special, but certainly\nuseful. Thinking back of what I wrote, do you think worms have minds\nor not? They are able to experience pain, at least they behave \njust like that. Yet it is conceivable that we might some day\nin the future perform a \"total synthesis of C. elegans\" from\nthe elements. Would such a worm have a mind?\n\n> Firstly, I'm not impressed with the ability of algorithms.

However, I do not think that our brains\nwork like computers, at all. In fact, there is substantial evidence\n(Skarda, 1985; Skarda & Freeman 1987) that brains work more or less\nchaotically, generating enough randomness for mental states to evolve.\nOur brains work much like genetic algorithm generators, I suppose.\n\n> the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered.

This is somewhat unlikely, given that\n> our brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic\n> material, much of which isn't used.\n\nIndeed, this is extremely unlikely, given the vast impact of nurture\non our mind and brain. I suggest, however, that before trying to\nunderstand our consciousness as a collection of algorithms. \n\nKevin, take a look at the references I mentioned, and think again.\nI still think the best experts on the nature of a conscious mind\nare neurologists, neuropsychologists and biologists (but do not \nflame me for my opinions), since they study beings that are\nconscious. \n\nThe reason I am repeating my advice is that this discussion cannot\nlead to anywhere if our backgrounds are too different.\n\nAnd please, do not bring QM into this discussion at all - not\nall physicists are happy with the claim that our consciousness\nplays some special role in physics. I would say it doesn't.\n\n> The other problem with algorithms is their instability.

Don't forget this. This does not\nmean they need something else to work - they just work differently.\nTheir primary 'purpose' is perception and guidance of action, \nself-awareness and high intelligence are later appearances.\n\n> The next problem is the sticky question of \"What is colour?\" (replace\n> 'colour' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, the\n> materialist viewpoint is that it's the product of some kind of\n> chemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy +\n> different chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these?\n\nYou are still expecting that we could find the idea of 'green' in\nour brains somewhere, perhaps in the form of some chemical. This is\nnot how I see it. The sensation 'green' is a certain time-dependent\npattern in the area V4 of our visual cortex, and it is distributed\nwith the help of areas V1 and V2 to the rest of the brain. \n\nIndeed, a firing pattern. I have sometimes thought of our consciousness\nas a global free induction pattern of these local firing patterns,\nbut this is just idle speculation.\n\nScientific American's September 1992 issue was a special issue on\nmind and brain. Have you already read it from cover to cover? ;-)\nThere are two articles on visual perception, so you might be \ninterested.\n\nBut again, please note that subjective experiences cannot be \nobserved from a third-person perspective. If we see nothing but \nneuronal activity, we cannot go on to conclude that this is not the\nmind.\n\nKalat (1988) writes about numerous examples where electric stimulation\nof different areas of brain have led to various changes in the \npatients' state of mind. For instance, a patient whose septal area\nwas stimulated (without his knowledge) by remote control during\na psychiatric interview was quickly cured of his depression, and\nstarted discussing a plan to seduce his girlfriend.\n\nStimulations in the temporal lobe have sometimes led to embarrassing\nsituations, when the patients have started flirting with the\ntherapist.\n\nIn conclusion, there is evidence that\n\n1) brains are essentially necessary for subjective experiences, \n   brain damage is usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage\n\n2) conscious processes involve substantial brain activity in\n   various areas of brain - when we think of colours, our\n   visual cortex is activated etc.\n\n3) consciousness is an afterthought - we become conscious of our\n   actions with a half a second delay, and our brains are ahead\n   of our 'conscious will' by at least 350 ms. \n\nThus, I think it is fruitful to turn the question \"Why do 'I' see\ncolours\" around and ask \"What is this 'I' that seems to be \nobserving?\", since it seems that our conscious mind is not\nthe king of our brains.\n\n> If this is so, a\n> computer won't see colour, because the chemistry is different.

Does a neural\nnetwork that is capable of recognising handwritten numbers from\n0 to 9 see the numbers, if it is capable of sorting them?\n\nIf you are asking, \"why does an animal who is conscious of itself\nas an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal who\ndoesn't\", I have a good answer - read my previous posting,\nwhere I wrote why a sense of identity helps social animals to swap\nroles and act more morally, so that they don't unconsciously\nkill each other with newly discovered weapons. (A bit extreme,\nbut this is the basic idea.)\n\nWhen early _Homo_ became more and more efficient in using tools, \na sense of identity and the concept of 'self' had to evolve in\nline with this development. Indeed, respect for others and \nconscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantages\nfor social animals, such as early humans. \n\n> If I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction,\n> with two processes acting on it.

Dr. James DeYoung; #3]\n\nR. Scroggs\n\n     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and\nsuggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a\n\"Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic\nterminology.\"  The term is derived from Lev 18\"22 & 20:13 where the LXX\njuxtaposes the two words arsenos (\"male\") and koiten (\"bed\"), and represents\nthe Hebrew miskab zabar (\"lying with a male\").   Yet he believes that Paul did\nnot originate the term, but borrowed it from \"circles of Hellenistic Jews\nacquainted with rabbinic discussions\" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid\n\"contact with the usual Greek terminology\" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs\nobserves, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions\nof pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to\nnative-speaking Greeks (108).\n\n     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the\nobject of the second part, thus differing from Boswell's \"learned discussion\"\n(107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of \"one who lies with a\nmale\" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9),\nwhich Scroggs interprets as \"the effeminate call-boy,\" arsenokoitai is the\nactive partner \"who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress' or who hires him on\noccasion to satisfy his sexual desires\" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not\nrefer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic\nmodel of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he\naffirms (109).\n     This is Scrogg's interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The\ncombination of pornoi (\"fornicators\"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai (\"slave\ndealers\") refers to \"male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave\ndealers [who procure them]\" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of\npederasty \"which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual\npurposes, and the use of these boys by adult males\" (121).  Even \"serious\nminded pagan authors\" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these\ninstances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently\ngeneral condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. \nConsequently Paul \"Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind\" (122).\nWe cannot know what Paul would have said about the \"contemporary model of\nadult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships\" (122).\n\n     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical\nconcerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of\nvices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and\nfunction of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any\nrelationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually\nnonexistent.  He concludes that Paul \"does not care about any specific item in\nthe lists\" (104). \n\n     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary\nphenomenon of a \"catalogue of vices,\"  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are\n\"irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today\" (129).  The \"model\nin today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model\nattacked by the NT\" that \"Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not\nrelevant to today's debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational\ndiscussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify\nrefusal of ordination. . . \" (127).\n\n      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI\n\nD. Wright\n\n     In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have\ncome under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell's\nview is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out\nseveral shortcomings of Boswell's treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults\nBoswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev\n18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the \"Apostolic\nConstitutions,\"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). \nBoswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term\nderives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This\nis significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell's\nclaim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the\ngender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean \"a male who sleeps with\na male,\" making arseno- the object.\n\n     Wright also faults Boswell's claims regarding linguistic features of the\nterm, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that\ncompounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it\nas an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely\none of dialectical diversity: \"No semantic import attaches to the difference\nbetween the two forms\" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which\nthe second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its\nobject and where \"the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its\ngender\" (132). \n\n     It is with Boswell's treatment of the early church fathers that Wright\ntakes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. \nFor example, Aristides' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis,\nandrobaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male\nhomosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell's discussion.  Boswell fails to cite\nHippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the\nSyriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to\nthe Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34). \n\n     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in\nparallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the\ndominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this\nparallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia (\"adultery\"), porneia\n(\"fornication\"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris\n(136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the\nTen Commandments as \"You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis (\"you shall not commit\nadultery\"), ou paidophthoreseis (\"you shall not practice homosexuality with\nboys\"), you shall not steal. . .\" (150 n. 43).\n\n     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein (\"commit homosexuality\") exists in the\nSibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was\ncoined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by\nOr.Sib., book 2 (137-38).\n\n     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew\nupon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John\nthe Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of\nhomosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.\n\n     Wright next replies to Boswell's contention that the term would not be\nabsent \"from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted\n(140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to\nthe first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used\ndozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g.\nDidache) show no acquaintance with Paul's letters or deliberately avoid citing\nScripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). \n\n     Boswell's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright's attention\n(141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom,\nomitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a\nlong uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom\n1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom's infrequent use of the term.  Wright\nobserves that Boswell has \"signally failed to demonstrate any us of\narsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual\nactivity\" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature\nand the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly\nspecified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world. \n\n     Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim\nand I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning\n\"homosexual\" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of\nthe word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell's limited\nconclusion based on them.\n\n     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the\ncatalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed\nin late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of\nhomosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the\npart of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into\nbeing under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke \"generally of\nmale activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual\nengagement with paides\" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were\ninterchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).\n\n     In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning\nhomosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and\nothers who limit the term to \"active male prostitutes\" or pederasty are without\nsignificant support from linguistic and historical studies.  \n\n[Next: the questioning of Wrights position by William Peterson.  After that, we\nget into the \"good\" stuff of historical & linguistic studies.  THis will\ninclude \"Symposium\" by Plato.  If there is any doubt as to the modern\nunderstanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time of\nPaul, this will certainly clear things up.  Also we will review Paul's use of\nLev18-20 in the NT and how, as for him, 1) the Law was fulfilled, but not done\naway with, 2) Lev 18-20 was the universal and the following chapters the\ngeneral.  Those who put forth that the OT no longer holds true today in our\nculture, should stick around for this one.]\n___________________________\n13 R. Scroggs, THe New Testament and Homosexuality (Phil: 1983) 86, 107-8. \nIndependently we came to the same conclusion.  Apparently the connection is\nmade in E.A. Sophocles, Greek Lexicon of the Roman & Byzantine Periods (from\n146BC to AD 1100).\n14   See discussion, 101-4.  He says the same thing about Paul's language in\nRom 1:26-27 (128).  But this is doubtful.  See the more cautious words of P.\nZaas, \"I Cor 6.9ff: Was Homosexuality Condoned in the Corinthian Church? SBLASP\n17 (1979):205-12.  He observes that the words moixai, malakoi, and arsenokoitai\nwere part of Jewish anti-Gentile polemic.  Yet Paul's wors at the end of the\nvice list, \"and such were some of you,\" indicate that \"Paul is addressing real\nor potential abuses of his ethical message, not citing primitive tradition by\nrote\" (210).  Wright disputes Zaas' attempt to associate the term with idolatry\n(147).\n15  On Boswell's treatment of Rom 1:26-7, the article by R.B. Hays, \"Relations\nNatural and Unnatural\"  A Response to John Boswell's Exegesis of Romans 1,\" JRE\n14/1 (Spring 1986): 184-215, is an excellent critique.\n16  D.F. Wright, \"Homosexuals or Prostitutes?  The Meaning of ARSENOKOITAI (I\nCor 6:9, I Tim 1:10), VC 38 (1984):125-53.\n17  In an unpublished paper, Henry Mendell, \"ARSENOKOITAI: Boswell on Paul,\"\neffectively refutres Boswell's claims regarding the philology of arsenokoitai. \nHe finds the meaning to be general, \"a male who has sex with a male\" (4-11).  \n18  Wright's endnotes (148-49) list additional sources in the church fathers.\n19   We also have noticed the same tendency by Boswell to fail to cite all the\nreferences to Sodom and sodomy in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha.  See  J.B.\nDeYoung, \"A Critique of Prohomosexual Interpretations of the OT Apocrypha and\nPseudepigrapha,\" BSac 146/588 (1990):437-53.\n20   In light of the claim made by Boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitai\npoints to a meaning lacking homosexual significance, Wright asks pertinently\n\"why neither Philo nor Josephus use  paidofthoria, nor Josephus paiderastia,\nand why . . Clement did not use the latter and Chrysostom the former?\"  (152 n.\n71)  In a more recent article, \"Homosexuality: The Relevance of the Bible,\" EvQ\n61 (1989):291-300, Wright reiterates these same points.  Paul shows a\n\"remarkable originality\" in extending the OT ethic to the church (300).\n\n \n", "true_class": 1, "title": "ID 12 (TP-TP)"}, {"text": "From: Alan.Olsen@p17.f40.n105.z1.fidonet.org (Alan Olsen)\nSubject: After 2000 years, can we say that Christian Morality is\nLines: 29\n\n\nMC> Theory of Creationism: MY theistic view of the theory of\nMC> creationism, (there  are many others) is stated in Genesis\nMC> 1.

They're\ngreat at solving problems once the method has been worked out, but not\nat working out the method itself.\n\nAs a specific example, I like to solve numerical crosswords (not the\nsimple do-the-sums-and-insert-the-answers type, the hard ones.) To do\nthese with any efficiency, you need to figure out a variety of tricks.\nNow, I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles, but\nin doing so you have to work out the tricks _yourself_, and program\nthem into the computer. You can, of course, 'obfuscate' the trick, and\nwrite the program so that it is uncovered, but as far as I can see,\nthe trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered. Does\nthis mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already\npre-programmed into our brains? This is somewhat unlikely, given that\nour brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic\nmaterial, much of which isn't used.\n\nOne way around this is to bring the environment into the equation, but\n(again, as far as I can see) this still has an air of 'if you see\nobject X, then perform action Y,' and we don't seem to get anywhere.\nThe algorithm has to anticipate what it might see, and what\nconclusions to draw from it's experience.\n\nThe other problem with algorithms is their instability. Not many\nalgorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code, yet\npeople survive strokes without going completely haywire (there are\nside-effects, but patients still seem remarkably stable.) Also,\nneurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate -\ncan an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it's\ncode?\n\nThe next problem is the sticky question of \"What is colour?\" (replace\n'colour' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, the\nmaterialist viewpoint is that it's the product of some kind of\nchemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy +\ndifferent chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these? If this is so, a\ncomputer won't see colour, because the chemistry is different. Does an\nalgorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an\nequivalent that doesn't? It shouldn't, because the outputs of each\nalgorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances. So why do\nwe see colour?\n\n\n>\n>However, such a view is actually a nonsolution. How should minds be\n>able to act as observers, feel pain and pleasure and issue\n>commands any better than the brain? Moreover, how do the interactions\n>occur?\n\nA bit of idle speculation...\n\nIf I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction,\nwith two processes acting on it. The first process has been called\n'Unitary Evolution' (or 'U'), is governed by Schroedinger's equation\nand is well known. The second process, called various things such as\n'collapse of the wavefunction' or 'state vector reduction' (or 'R'),\nand is more mysterious. It is usually said to occur when a\n'measurement' takes place, although nobody seems to know precisely\nwhen that occurs. When it does occur, the effect of R is to abruptly\nchange the wavefunction.\n\nI envisage R as an interaction between the wavefunction and 'something\nelse,' which I shall imaginitively call 'part X.' It seems reasonable\nto assume that _something_ causes R, although that something might be\nthe wavefunction itself (in which case, part X is simply the\nwavefunction. Note, though, that we'd need more than U to explain R.)\n\nAnyway, I'm speculating that minds would be in part X. There seems to\nbe some link between consciousness and R, in that we never see linear\nsuperpositions of anything, although there are alternative\nexplainations for this. I've no idea how a brain is supposed to access\npart X, but since this is only speculation, that won't matter too\nmuch :-) My main point is that there might be a place for minds in\nphysics.\n\nI'll go back to my nice padded cell now, if that's OK with you :-)\n\n>\n>\n>Petri\n\n-- \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKevin Anthoney                                         kax@cs.nott.ac.uk\n            Don't believe anything you read in .sig files.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n", "true_class": 0, "title": "ID 365 (TN-FP)"}, {"text": "From: frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O'Dwyer)\nSubject: Re: Societal basis for morality\nOrganization: Siemens-Nixdorf AG\nLines: 49\nNNTP-Posting-Host: d012s658.ap.mchp.sni.de\n\nIn article <1993Apr20.004119.6119@cnsvax.uwec.edu> nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu (David Nye) writes:\n\nYou asked me to look over here, but I was on my way back anyway :-)\n\n#[reply to cobb@alexia.lis.uiuc.edu (Mike Cobb)]\n# \n#>If morals come from what is societally accepted, why follow that?

A generation\nbefore the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh,\ngateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather\nthan God's way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which would\nhave given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored their\ndecision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the\nland of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision-\nmakers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and\ndestined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the\ntime they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderers\nhad been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with a\nsigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they\nwere going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence.\nWhatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached\nbones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression of\nhopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nation\nat Kadesh and had God' s promise of one day entering the land. The\nforty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, those\nwho were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the\ninheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Moses\nprays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over.\nAll these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining\npeople through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden.\nHis was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but\nhe also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem was\nthat they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. \"Who is your\nGod?\" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. When\nAaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or young\nbull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bull\nwho had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt's gods as He led\nIsrael to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles grow\nthin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and water\ngushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the\nGod of Almightiness becomes \"ho-hum --What' s next on the miracle menu?\"\nAnd a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He might\nbe all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a right\nto do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these people\nhad known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men's lives had hung\non the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believed\nGod could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIM\nand, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, His\nacts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From the\nday of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God.\nAt Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. He\nhad seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. This\nrequest was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God's glorious\nPerson. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and\nlovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word \"lovingkindness\" is not to be\nunderstood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationship\narising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as the\nlove that says, \"I will never leave you nor forsake you.\" Lovingkindness is as\ntenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its\nheels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based on\nfeelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and,\ntherefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God's love is not an emotion\nthat wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our\nhighest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. God\ndoes not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings\nof love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with\nus! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Him\nto reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- not\nbecause of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committed\nto us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He will\nnot let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us--\nbut a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It is\nsaying to the recipient, \"For as long as we shall live, I am for you.\"  The God\nwho has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--in\nHis coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who is\nlovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will never\nleave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him as\nlove; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeing\nmiracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in the\nheart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power.\nMoses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had for\nthese people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, they\ncould not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born out\nof knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One who\ngives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is to\nmiss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  If\nman is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on\nknowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues from\nlove demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years of\nmeaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to\nknow the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and the\npossibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. The\nlanguage Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its\nmother's love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It is\nwaking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for,\nprotected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we were\nto ask, \"What has the baby done to deserve this?\" or, \"Have arrangements\nbeen made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?\" Our\nquestions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child was\nconceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love's excitement, a love\nthat has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents' love is\nunconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child\nor its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally,\nspontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after\nHis image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the\nLord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to\nearn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identity\nthrough the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents' love. It is a\nscientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if\nit survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has been\nheld and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the\nembrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the new\ngeneration will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in\nthe love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and\ngladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His\nlove. \"Satisfied.\" in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing\nbeing filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describe\nthe earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received\nenough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be\ndrenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is the\nlifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in our\ndeepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems\ndisappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling\nthat he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make\nsense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks this\nsatisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the\nemotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in\nreligious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding\nto the love of the living God. Only in knowing God's love will the rest of life\nmake sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again\nbecame the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find it\nfascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His\nlove. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one would\nthink he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by\nthe knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knew\nbetter. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won't\nfind it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to\nmanipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and\ngive us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyes\nand satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking God\nto make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses' prayer was partially\nanswered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which\nworked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in its\nfullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out the\nlove of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church,\nwe read of the Holy Spirit \"falling upon\" the believers. This is an ancient\nexpression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used in\nLuke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and \"falling on his\nneck and kissing him.\" The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest\nself and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your\nbeing. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes.\nMoses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization\nthat we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taught\nus to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in a\nstate of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance\nand love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive love\nwe cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the Holy\nSpirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness to\nthink on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jaded\nwith the doctrine of \"perform to be accepted.\" We begin to realize that He\nloves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challenge\neveryone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your\neyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may not\nfeel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed the\nother day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians kept\nbehind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rays\nwithout being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing\nthat we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according to\nMoses, \"joy and gladness all our days.\" Joy is the result of a life that is\nfunctioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might say\nthat joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance.

Karma is considered to\nbe a moral process in which intentions (either good or evil) shape\na person's predilections for future intention and action and\nproduce a person who is more prone to good than evil, or the opposite --\n\"reward\" has nothing to do with it.  Both Jainism and Buddhism are atheistic\nso there is no deity to dispense rewards or punishments.  Karma is usually\ndescribed in terms of seeds and reaping the fruit thereof.  In fact \"As you\nsow, so shall you reap\" is found in the Pali Canon as I recall, the metaphor\nof natural growth is explicit.\n\nHinduism, or some sects in that tradition, are I believe much more\ndeterministic and involve concepts closer to reward and punishment being\ntheistically inclined.\n\nIn point of fact, the Theravadin Buddhist tradition of Southeast Asia\nconsiders karma as only one of five influences in human life, and in\nfact from their point of view they would be unable to explain the mechanics\nof karma without the element of free will.\n\nAlso in Eastern religions there is a difference between reincarnation and\nrebirth, which is essentially absent in Western considerations.\n\nIsn't Origen usually cited as the most prestigious proponent of reincarnation\namong Christian thinkers?

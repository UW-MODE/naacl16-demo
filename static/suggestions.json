However, I heard an interesting story about Pope John Paul II\nfrom an astronomer who teaches at the University of Cracow.  The Pope likes\nto go to Poland for a scientific conference every couple of years so he\ncan relax and talk Polish to friends and fellow countrymen.  My acquaintance,\nan anthroposophist, related the fact that Woitila knew about Steiner and\nAnthroposophy from his early days.  Before he became a priest he was an\nactor in a dramatic company in Cracow whose leader was a pupil of Steiner\nand based his acting and directing methods on Steiner's indications.  Part\nof the work was the study of the basic works of anthroposophy.  Well,\ngoing to this conference with him a few years ago, the astronomer and another\nPolish anthroposophist thought they would ask the Pope what he thought about\nAnthroposophy.  They chickened out at the last minute, but one of them did ask\nhim what he thought about reincarnation.  The Pope smiled and said, \n\"Actually there have been quite a few good Catholics who believed in \nreincarnation,\" and he proceeded to name several from the earliest times\nto modern times.

I am on an\ninformation gathering venture regarding the various expressions of\nChristianity/churches there are.  \n        My husband and I come from very different, but completely\nChristian backgrounds.  I was a Lutheran when I met him and he was a\nborn and raised Church of Christ member.  At first I agreed with a lot\nof what the C of C was about, I wanted to move from the liturgical\nbased Lutheran church to something a little more Biblical based.\nHowever over the last year, I've been regretting changing to the\nChurch of Christ for a number of reasons - for one thing I am not a\nfundamentalist and believe that a few things in the Bible are\nsocio-cultural in nature and don't relate to the Christian doctrine.\nOne of my sorest spots is the role of women.  I believe that through\nMary and other women, Chris validated women as worthy disciples - but\nin the C of C the writings of Paul are taken without exception and I\nam told that I am not an equal partner in my marriage but the lesser\nmember, I am to submit to my husband in all things (if I hear that\nverse one more time....) and I am not to take an active role in\nanything which might be construed as putting me in authority over men\n(ie leading prayers, conducting Bible studies etc).   The last straw\nwas when the Elders at our church came down on one of our college\ngroups because it was all-women and they wanted a man to lead the\nstudy.\nAlso my husband and I really resent the way everyone at our church\nfeels that if you aren't a conservative republican - you aren't a REAL\nChristian (I got told that nobody who voted for Clinton should call\nthemselves a Christian).  Hence we are subjected during the service to\nlong prayers calling for things we flatly dont agree with.  We are\nalso don't agree with the C of C's dread of any new \"movement\" being\nled by the young people.\n\nSo, we have been church hunting with NO success.  I want a reasonably\nbiblical based church where women are viewed as whole people no matter\nwhat their calling ( C of C really looked down on career women).\nChristopher is looking for a church with deeply rooted religious\nconvictions, with adult baptism and a church where the members still\nbring their Bibles to service.\n\nWe are so confused here and we're drifting around trying to find a\nplace where we both feel loved and can express our faith honestly and\nwithout reservation.  If anyone can point us in a direction we'd be\nthrilled!\nI'm afraid that it will be very hard for me to go back to C of C and\neven harder for me to stay churchless for long.\n\nany responses would be welcome\n\n\nthe diel family\n\n[I would think somewhere in the Baptist spectrum you might find what\nyou're looking for.  However the issue is probably more one of the\nflavor of the specific local churches in your area than the\ndenomination -- Baptists cover quite a spectrum.  Adult baptism sort\nof narrows your choices on the more liberal end of the spectrum.\nHistorically that's been associated with movements that have the\ncharacter you're trying to avoid.  --clh]\n", "title": "Example 189"}], "lr-svm": [{"text": "From: poram%mlsma@att.att.com\nSubject: Re: Deuterocanonicals, esp.

Since authority is a matter of both\ncommunicator and recepiant we can say that, for example \"Jesus\nis Lord\" whether the world at large accepts the authority or\nnot. Thus the Bible can be considered for its authoritative\ncontent whether or not it is accepted (This issue is at the\nheart of Pilate's pragmatic question \"What is truth?\" to Jesus\nwhen our Lord was brought before Him. Jesus' reply was to appeal\nto the authority of his Father)\nYou also might like to consider the claimed authority\nrepresented by the statements \"thus says the Lord\" in the Bible,\nwhich claim to put across the exact words of God.\n\nYou fall into the danger of relativism with your rejection of\ninherant authority and claim that it lies only in the \"community\nof faith\" - does something become truth because it is accepted?\nThe main thrust of my argument is that there is a Godward\ndirection as well as a manward (which is where the reference to\nRev 22 came in.)\n\n>: 2.

If we\ncan't measure anything objectively, then the answers we get from physics\naren't objective either.  That's what I mean when I say there's no objective\nphysics.\n\nSure, we can all agree that (say) F = GMm/r^2, but that's maths.

He was\n    married to a most virtuous young woman and they lived happily  in\n    a  humble  home which was in the midst of a large, beautiful val-\n    ley. After living many, happy years together, Jacob's wife\tdied,\n    leaving  him alone with only one friend...his daughter Mary. Even\n    as a child Mary was uncommonly pretty; but as she grew in  years,\n    her piety, her innocence, her modesty and her unfeigned kindne ss\n    towards all she came in contact with, gave to her beauty  a  rare\n    and  peculiar  charm. Her face was lighted up with a look of such\n    indescribable goodness, that  it  seemed  almost  as  though  one\n    looked upon an angel.\n\n    Mary's greatest delight was the beautiful garden and her  favour-\n    ite  flowers  were the violet, the lily and the rose. Jacob loved\n    to point to them as emblems of the virtues most becoming  to  her\n    gender.  When\tshe  once, early in March brought the first violet to\n    him and joyfully called upon him to admire it, he said:\n\n    Let the modest violet, my dear Mary, be to you an image of humil-\n    ity  and  of the benevolence that does good in secret. It clothes\n    itself in the tender colours of modesty; it prefers to  bloom  in\n    retired  grots; it fills the air with its fragrance while remain-\n    ing hidden beneath the leaves.  May you also, my  dear  Mary,  be\n    like  the  retiring violet, avoiding vain display, not seeking to\n    attract the public\teye,  but  preferring  ever  to  do  good  in\n    quietude and peace.\n\n    One morning when the roses and lilies were in full bloom and  the\n    garden appeared in its richest array, Jacob said to his daughter,\n    as he pointed out a beautiful lily,  which\twas  beaming  in  the\n    morning sun:\n\n    Let the lily my dear child, be to you the emblem\n     of purity. Look how beautiful, how pure and fair it is! The whi-\n    test  linen is as nothing compared with the purity of its petals:\n    they are like the snow. Happy the maiden whose heart is  as  pure\n    and as free from stain. But the purest of all colours is also the\n    hardest\n\n\t\t\t\t   -5-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    to preserve pure. Easily is the petal of the lily  soiled;\ttouch\n    it\tbut carelessly or roughly and a stain is left behind.  In the\n    same way, a word or a thought may stain the purity of  innocence!\n    Then pointing to a rose he said:\n\n     Let the rose my dear Mary, be to you an emblem of modesty.  More\n    beautiful  than the colour of the rose is the blush that rises to\n    the cheek of a modest girl. It is a sign that she is  still  pure\n    of\theart  and  innocent in thought. Happy is the maiden whom the\n    suggestion of a thought that is indelicate, will cause to  blush,\n    as\tshe  is thus put on her guard against the approach of danger.\n    The cheeks which readily blush will remain for a long  time  with\n    their  roseate  hue, while those which fail to blush at the least\n    indelicacy of thought will soon  become  pale  and\twan,  and  go\n    before their time to the grave.\"\n\n\n\n\n    Among the many fruit trees that adorned the garden there was  one\n    that  was  prized above all the others. It was an apple tree, not\n    much larger than a rose bush, and stood by itself in  the  middle\n    of\tthe garden. Mary's father had planted it the day that she was\n    born and every year it bore a number of beautiful apples. Once it\n    blossomed  earlier\tthan  usual  and with unusual luxuriance. The\n    tree was one mass of blossom. Mary was so delighted with it  that\n    she went every morning as soon as she was dressed to look at\n     it. Once, when it was in full bloom, she called  to  her  father\n    and said:\n\n    Look father, how beautiful! Was there ever such a lovely mingling\n    of\tred  and  white?  The whole tree looks like one huge bunch of\n    flowers!\n\n    The next morning she hastened into the garden to feast  her  eyes\n    once  more\tupon the tree. But what was her grief to see that the\n    frost had nipped it and destroyed all its flowers. They were  all\n    become  brown  and\tyellow\tand  when  the\tsun came forth in its\n    strength they withered and fell to the ground. Mary  wept  bitter\n    tears at the sight. Then said the father:\n\n    Thus, does sinful pleasure destroy the  bloom  of  youth.  Oh  my\n    child,  never  cease to remember how dreadful it is to be seduced\n    from the path of right! Behold in the example of the  apple  tree\n    an\timage of what would happen if you were to wander from the way\n    - if the hopes your conduct  hitherto  has\traised\tin  my\theart\n    should  vanish,  not  merely for a day or year, but for life. Ah,\n    then how much more bitter would be the tears which I  would  shed\n    over your lapse from virtue than those which now course down your\n    cheeks! Life would have no joys for me: with tears in my eyes  I\n    should\n\n\t\t\t\t   -6-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    go down sorrowfully to my grave.\n\n    As he spoke, the tears stood in his eyes; Mary was deeply  moved,\n    and  the words he uttered made so profound an impression upon her\n    mind that she never forgot them.\n\n    Under the eyes of a father so  loving  and\twise,  and  amid  the\n    flowers  of  her  garden, Mary grew daily in stature and intelli-\n    gence - blooming as a rose, pure as a  lily  and  retiring\tas  a\n    violet, and as full of promise as a tree laden with blossom.\n\n    Happy was the old man at all times to behold how plenteously  the\n    fruits  of\this  garden  rewarded his diligent toil; but with how\n    much more happiness and content did he mark the  gracious  effect\n    produced  upon  the heart and mind of his beloved daughter by his\n    pious teaching and example.\n\n    Jacob plucked several roses and lilies, tied them together\tin  a\n    bunch and gave them to Mary with the words:\n\n    The lily and the rose, sister flowers as they are, belong the one\n    to\tthe  other;  both incomparable in their beauty, they are ren-\n    dered still more lovely by being together. In  the\tsame  way  my\n    dear  child  are innocence and modesty twin sisters of virtue and\n    cannot be separated\n\n\n\n\n    The greatest and most powerful guardian of purity is the  thought\n    of the presence of God\n\n-- \nInternet: simon@giaeb.cc.monash.edu.au  \nViva Cristo Rey !!

Since authority is a matter of both\ncommunicator and recepiant we can say that, for example \"Jesus\nis Lord\" whether the world at large accepts the authority or\nnot. Thus the Bible can be considered for its authoritative\ncontent whether or not it is accepted (This issue is at the\nheart of Pilate's pragmatic question \"What is truth?\" to Jesus\nwhen our Lord was brought before Him. Jesus' reply was to appeal\nto the authority of his Father)\nYou also might like to consider the claimed authority\nrepresented by the statements \"thus says the Lord\" in the Bible,\nwhich claim to put across the exact words of God.\n\nYou fall into the danger of relativism with your rejection of\ninherant authority and claim that it lies only in the \"community\nof faith\" - does something become truth because it is accepted?\nThe main thrust of my argument is that there is a Godward\ndirection as well as a manward (which is where the reference to\nRev 22 came in.)\n\n>: 2.

It is to do with the quality of writing, which should\nhave the ability to fire the mind, affect our thought life and\ncause us to act in a certain way - there is something of this\nin Jesus' quote: \"Man does not live by bread alone, but by every\nword that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord\".

I love it,\nbut I am not very familiar with the different denominations, or\ntraditions, or common beliefs of various christian groups.\nI have heard various people (outside this news group)\ndescribe *idols* such as power, money, material \npossessions etc.  These things are worshiped in some sense I \nsuppose, but I never really gave idols much thought.

I know who she is, \nbut that's about it.  It seems to me that a statue of Mary \ncould be considered an idol?

Any help you can \ngive me will be appreciated.\n\n    -------------------------------------------\n\n[I don't think the issue is so much that people are more educated than\nyou (though it may well be that they are), as that they come from a\ndifferent tradition than yours.\n\nThis is a discussion between Catholics and Protestants.  Catholics\ngenerally believe that Mary was sinless.  Protestants do not.  The\nissue comes down to different sources of authority.  Protestants\ngenerally limit themselves to the Bible as a source of doctrine.\nSince this isn't in the Bible (except in passages that no one would\nunderstand in this way if they didn't already believe it), Protestants\ndon't accept it.  Catholics see continuing revelation through the\nChurch, though they believe the results are consistent with the Bible.\n\nI interpret your posting, not as a call for yet another argument about\nwhether the Catholic Marian devotions are idolatry (an argument I am\nnot prepared to see newed here), but as a sign of being interested in\nlearning about traditions other than your own.  Catholics are of\ncourse a major one, but by no means the only one.  I generally\nconsider the major traditions to be Catholic, Orthodox, and\nvarious subsets of Protestantism.  Within Protestantism, it's a matter\nof how finely you want to cut things.  These days I think the major\ndivision is between those who accept Biblical inerrancy and those\nwho don't.  There are also a number of major historical traditions,\nbut in recent decades distinctions are tending to blur.  I'd \nidentify the major Protestant traditions as:\n\n  Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican (they're sort of halfway between\n  Catholic and Protestant), Wesleyan, Baptist, Holiness, Pentecostal,\n  Church of Christ\n\nBut there are a number of others.  Historical distinctions tend not to\nbe so important among the liberal churches anymore, and I think\ncurrent trends in society and the Church are also tending to make\nconservatives seen themselves as allies from a general \"evangelical\"\nperspective.  But differences among these various traditions are still\nquite marked.\n\nI think the best introduction to these issues is to read a good book\non church history.  Anyone who wants to understand the church really\nneeds to understand how we got where we are now.  A church history\nwill normally show you where each of these traditions came from, and\ngive a feeling for their nature.  Unfortunately I'm away from my\nlibrary at the moment, so I don't have anything specific to recommend.\n\n--clh]\n", "title": "Example 486"}, {"text": "From: mls@panix.com (Michael Siemon)\nSubject: Re: Deuterocanonicals, esp.

The question, really, has to do with the\nstatus of the Greek Septuagint versus Hebrew scripture.  And the issue\npredates the Reformation by quite a bit -- Jerome was negative about the\n\"deuteroncanonicals\" and in fact, even though he transalted them, he put\nthem after the Hebrew canon (reordered from the Greek ordering to the\nHebrew one.)  His translations of them were quick-and-dirty, also (he\nreports having done one of them in one day, and another overnight, just\ndictating his translation to an amanuensis.\n\nThat is to say, it is the Vulgate, and all of its massive importance in\nWestern Christianity, along with the veneration of Jerome, which took the\nfirst steps in \"reducing\" these books from the status they had (and have)\namong the Greeks.\n\nFurthermore, it is inaccurate to say that the Reformers \"threw out\" these\nbooks.  Basically, they just placed them in a secondary status (as Jerome\nhad already done), but with the additional warning that doctrine should\nnot be based on citations from these ALONE.\n\nI think that the emphasis on the Hebrew originals is sound, though it\nseems somewhat arbitrary to disallow on the face of it a translation as\npart of a collection whose principles of selection (in Hebrew or Greek)\nare confused or unknown and likely fraught with accident.  It also seems\nto play into a tendentious notion of the original languages being somehow\n\"more inspired\" -- as if magical, and conveying a message untranslatable\n-- than a translation, as if we could not hear God's word to the Jews in\nGreek (or German, or English, ...).  This tendency seems to have got a\nbig boost in _sola scriptura_ Protestantism, even to the point of current\n\"inerrancy\" bizarreness, despite the more basic, underlying tendency of\nthe Reformers to see that the texts SHOULD and COULD be translated.  If\nwe can profit from an English rendering of Hebrew and Greek, there is\nsurely little reason to keep Sirach, at least, out of our Bibles (and of\ncourse, Anglicans don't do so :-)).  For texts originally in Greek, it\nwould seem more to be anti-Greek prejudice (notably, by the time the\nHebrew canon is fully attested, including anti-Christian prejudice which\nled to the Jewish abandonment of the Septuagint) which is operative.\n\nBTW: readers may enjoy some lectures of Bruce Metzger on the issues of\ntranslation of the Bible (including some of what I said about Jerome,\nabove) in the current numbers of the journal _Bibliotheca Sacra_; two\nof four have been published so far.\n-- \nMichael L.

The disciples then went\nto a mountain previously agreed opon, and met Jesus there.  This was his only\nappearance, except to the women at the tomb.  Matthew only devotes five verses\nto the visit with the disciples.\n\nMark says that Jesus walked with two of the disciples in the country, and that\nthey told the rest of the disciples, who refused to believe.  Later he\nappeared to the 11 disciples at mealtime.\n\nLuke says two followers went, the same day that Jesus rose from the dead, to\nEmmaus, a village eight miles from Jeruselem, and there Jesus jioned them but\nwas unrecognised.  While they ate a meal together that evening, they finally\nrecognised Jesus, whereopon he dissapeared.  Returning at once to Jeruselem,\nthey told the\ndisciples of their experience, and suddenly Jesus appeared among them,\nfrightening them, as they thought he was a spirit.  Jesus then ate some fish\nand honey and then preached to them.\n\nJohn says Jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he arrose, in\nJeruselem, where they were hiding.  He breathed the Holy Ghost opon them, but\nThomas was not present and refused to believe. Eight days later Jesus joined\nthe disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced Thomas.\tOnce\nmore Jesus made an\nappearance to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias but again was not\nrecognised.\n After telling them to cast their netson the other side of the boat, Jesus\nbecomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them.  They all eat\ntogether and converse.\n\nThe book of acts further adds to the confusion.  It says that Jesus showed\nhimself to the apostles for a period of 40 days after his resurection (thus\ncontradicting Matthew, Mark, Luke AND John) and spoke to them of things\npertaining to the kingdom of God: \"And when he had spoken these things, while\nthey beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud recieved him out of their sight. \nAnd while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, two men stood\nby them in white apparel: Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye\ngazing into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken from you into heaven,\nshall so comein like manneras ye have seen him go into heaven\" Acts 1:3-11\n\nPaul outdoes every other \"authority\" by saying that Jesus was seen by 500\npersons between the time of the resurection and the\nassension, although he does not say where.\tHe also claims that he himself \"as\none born out of due time\" also saw Jesus. 1 Cor 15:6-8.\n\n>The Ascension\n\nMatthew says nothing about it.\tMark casually says that Jesus was recieved into\nheaven after he was finished talking with the\ndisciples in Jeruselem.  Luke says Jesus led the desciples to Bethany and that\nwhile he blessed them, he was parted from them and carried up into heaven. \nJohn says nothing about it.  Acts\ncontradicts all of the above.

Since authority is a matter of both\ncommunicator and recepiant we can say that, for example \"Jesus\nis Lord\" whether the world at large accepts the authority or\nnot. Thus the Bible can be considered for its authoritative\ncontent whether or not it is accepted (This issue is at the\nheart of Pilate's pragmatic question \"What is truth?\" to Jesus\nwhen our Lord was brought before Him. Jesus' reply was to appeal\nto the authority of his Father)\nYou also might like to consider the claimed authority\nrepresented by the statements \"thus says the Lord\" in the Bible,\nwhich claim to put across the exact words of God.\n\nYou fall into the danger of relativism with your rejection of\ninherant authority and claim that it lies only in the \"community\nof faith\" - does something become truth because it is accepted?\nThe main thrust of my argument is that there is a Godward\ndirection as well as a manward (which is where the reference to\nRev 22 came in.)\n\n>: 2. Is it prophetic?\n>\n>How is \"prophecy\" to be defined? If it is \"speaking forth\" of God's message,\n>much of the apocrypha must surely qualify.\n\nIf we narrowed it down to the predictive elements - which will\ncut out some of the 39 accepted OT books as well - we\nnonetheless have criteria for determining the validity of the\nbook: Jesus' standards were that \"Scripture cannot be broken\".\nCan you name a single prophecy that fits the bill in the Apocrapha?\n(ie definitely fulfilled AFTER it has been written)\n\n>: 3. Is it authentic?\n>\n>Again, by what standard?  Is \"authenticity\" a function of the authors? the\n>historical accuracy? \n\nDoes it have a subjective 'ring of truth' about it - and does\nother evidence that has come to light contradict or confirm the\nauthenticity?

Many of the apocryphal books are highly\n>\"dynamic\" -thought provoking, faithful, even exciting.\n\nWhat this is getting at is the relationship between text and\nreader. It is to do with the quality of writing, which should\nhave the ability to fire the mind, affect our thought life and\ncause us to act in a certain way - there is something of this\nin Jesus' quote: \"Man does not live by bread alone, but by every\nword that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord\". (Matt 4.4)\n\n>: 5. Is it received, collected, read and used?\n>\n>By whom?  Of course the apocryphal books were received (by some),\n>collected (or else we would not have them), read and used (and they still are,\n>in the Catholic and Orthodox churches).\n\nDoes the Catholic Church give the same authority to the\nApocrapha as to the accepted 66 books? Certainly it is not as\nwidely used as the OT and NT.\n\n>: On these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God.\n>\n>This is demonstrably false.\n\nThink about what I have said above. You may want to revise your\nconclusion. In addition think about other 'sacred writings', eg\nthe Koran, the book of Mormon and how and why you would\ncategorise them using the above principles. One word of caution\n- you may find some 'reflected glory' in some of these books: in\nthat the 'inspired quality' may be derived from the Bible.\nRemember that Lucifer is quite capable of appearing as an angel\nof light and quoting Scripture.\n\n>: To quote Unger's Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha:\n>: 1.

Put another way, the question is whether homosexual\nintercourse is the only act that Christians are supposed to believe\nis immoral solely on the basis that God says it is, with no insight\nbeing offered as to *why* it is immoral. No one could answer my\nquestion in either form from the Bible. (I did get an interesting\nresponse based on Roman Catholic theology).\n\nHowever, I think now that I can at least answer my first question.\nLink Hudson pointed me to it in his recent comments about sleeping\nwith one's aunt. Incest is held to be immoral in every society,\nthat is, there are some degrees of relationship where marriage\n(and thus, intercouse) is prohibited. The Bible is no exception.\nThe trouble is that it may be difficult to see *why* a particular\nrelationship qualifies as incestuous. Societies differ as to\nhow they define incest. Genetic reasons are sometimes offered, but\nall the Biblical cases cannot be dealt with that way. Why can't\na man sleep with his step mother--assuming that his father is\ndead and that he has \"married\" her? How does this case differ\nfrom the *duty* to marry one's brother's childless wife.\n\nAre these two cases parallel? Does the Bible prohibit some incestuous\nmarriages and homosexual marriages for the same reason, perhaps\nthat God knows they are not good for us and yet we are incapable\nof understanding why.\n\nP.S. Please don't bother writing me to tell me that I am a homophobe,\nas some did last time. My mind is not made up on these questions.\nYou don't know whether I am homophobic or not. You don't\nknow me.

I love it,\nbut I am not very familiar with the different denominations, or\ntraditions, or common beliefs of various christian groups.\nI have heard various people (outside this news group)\ndescribe *idols* such as power, money, material \npossessions etc.  These things are worshiped in some sense I \nsuppose, but I never really gave idols much thought.  Until now...  \n\nI have been reading the postings in this news group (which I \njust found a few days ago), and I have a question...  First, I'm\nnot trying to question anyone's belief or try to push my views\non anyone else (I haven't been at this long enough to have\nany views other than I cannot get to heaven by being good,\nI must understand that Christ bore my sins on the cross so that\nI could be saved and I need to repent, i.e. realize that\nevery time I sin, I might as well stick a sharp stick in\nChrist's side because He took the punishment for my sins,\nwhen He died on the cross).\n\nIn my studies, Mary never really comes up.  I know who she is, \nbut that's about it.  It seems to me that a statue of Mary \ncould be considered an idol?  Do people pray to statues of Mary?\n\nIt sounds like educated christians (more educated than myself\nI'm sure) believe Mary was sinless?  Wow...  I hoped to spend\nthe summer convincing myself (one way or the other) about\nTongues (I'm reading \"Charismatic Chaos\").  I guess I'll study\nTongues in parallel with reading this news group.  Any help you can \ngive me will be appreciated.\n\n    -------------------------------------------\n\n[I don't think the issue is so much that people are more educated than\nyou (though it may well be that they are), as that they come from a\ndifferent tradition than yours.\n\nThis is a discussion between Catholics and Protestants.  Catholics\ngenerally believe that Mary was sinless.  Protestants do not.  The\nissue comes down to different sources of authority.  Protestants\ngenerally limit themselves to the Bible as a source of doctrine.\nSince this isn't in the Bible (except in passages that no one would\nunderstand in this way if they didn't already believe it), Protestants\ndon't accept it.  Catholics see continuing revelation through the\nChurch, though they believe the results are consistent with the Bible.\n\nI interpret your posting, not as a call for yet another argument about\nwhether the Catholic Marian devotions are idolatry (an argument I am\nnot prepared to see newed here), but as a sign of being interested in\nlearning about traditions other than your own.  Catholics are of\ncourse a major one, but by no means the only one.  I generally\nconsider the major traditions to be Catholic, Orthodox, and\nvarious subsets of Protestantism.  Within Protestantism, it's a matter\nof how finely you want to cut things.  These days I think the major\ndivision is between those who accept Biblical inerrancy and those\nwho don't.  There are also a number of major historical traditions,\nbut in recent decades distinctions are tending to blur.  I'd \nidentify the major Protestant traditions as:\n\n  Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican (they're sort of halfway between\n  Catholic and Protestant), Wesleyan, Baptist, Holiness, Pentecostal,\n  Church of Christ\n\nBut there are a number of others.  Historical distinctions tend not to\nbe so important among the liberal churches anymore, and I think\ncurrent trends in society and the Church are also tending to make\nconservatives seen themselves as allies from a general \"evangelical\"\nperspective.  But differences among these various traditions are still\nquite marked.\n\nI think the best introduction to these issues is to read a good book\non church history.  Anyone who wants to understand the church really\nneeds to understand how we got where we are now.  A church history\nwill normally show you where each of these traditions came from, and\ngive a feeling for their nature.  Unfortunately I'm away from my\nlibrary at the moment, so I don't have anything specific to recommend.\n\n--clh]\n", "title": "Example 486"}, {"text": "From: mathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk>\nSubject: Alt.Atheism FAQ: Atheist Resources\nSummary: Books, addresses, music -- anything related to atheism\nKeywords: FAQ, atheism, books, music, fiction, addresses, contacts\nExpires: Thu, 27 May 1993 14:07:43 GMT\nDistribution: world\nOrganization: Mantis Consultants, Cambridge.

Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he\nremained sceptical.

When the\ndeity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is\nunable to comply.

He is accompanied by his dogmatic and\ndismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.\n\n\"The Divine Invasion\"\nGod invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from\nanother star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be\nassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.\n\nMARGARET ATWOOD\n\n\"The Handmaid's Tale\"\nA story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously\nassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it\n\"right\" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live\nunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked,\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\nretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \"old world\" are\nhunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to\nat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.\n\nVARIOUS AUTHORS\n\n\"The Bible\"\nThis somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.

ISBN (paper) 0-345-29887-X.\n\nRICHARD SWINBURNE\n\n\"The Existence of God (Revised Edition)\", Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford\nThis book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with \"The Coherence of\nTheism\" (1977) and was concluded with \"Faith and Reason\" (1981).  In this\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\ndecisively rejected in Mackie's \"The Miracle of Theism\".  In the revised\nedition of \"The Existence of God\", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he\nmakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.\n\nJ. L. MACKIE\n\n\"The Miracle of Theism\", Oxford\nThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal\narguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical\nphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through\nthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements\nof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \"replacements for\nGod\" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less\nformalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly direct\nwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.\n\nJAMES A.

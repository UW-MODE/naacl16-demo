Why must Baptism always be\nviewed by some people as a sort of \"prodigal son\" type of thing; i.e. a\nsudden change of heart, going from not accepting Christ to suddenly\naccepting Christ?  Why can't people start out with Christ from shortly\nafter birth, and build their relationship from there?  After all, does\na man suddenly meet a woman, and then marry her that same day?  From my\nexperiences, I've learned that all relationships must be built,\nincluding one's relationship with God.\n\n   Also Joe is speaking from the standpoint that Baptism is not just a\nritual, but that through it God bestows sacramental grace upon the\nrecipient.  Certainly for those with the mental faculties to know Christ\nit is necessary to believe in Him.  However, the Sacrament itself\nbestows grace on the recipient, and makes a permanent mark of adoption\ninto God's family on the soul.\n\n-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\nSteve Creps, Indiana University\ncreps@lateran.ucs.indiana.edu\n", "title": "Example 10"}, {"text": "From: frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O'Dwyer)\nSubject: Re: Theism and Fanatism (was: Islamic Genocide)\nOrganization: Siemens-Nixdorf AG\nLines: 164\nNNTP-Posting-Host: d012s658.ap.mchp.sni.de\n\nIn article <16BB7B863.I3150101@dbstu1.rz.tu-bs.de> I3150101@dbstu1.rz.tu-bs.de (Benedikt Rosenau) writes:\n#In article <1r0sn0$3r@horus.ap.mchp.sni.de>\n#frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O'Dwyer) writes:\n# \n#>|>#>#Theism is strongly correlated with irrational belief in absolutes.

STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC\n\n\tYour natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to\npanic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get right\nwith God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your \nonly chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the \nTribulation.  \"But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be \nsaved.\" - Matthew 24:13\n\nII. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION\n\n\tThe Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of\nthe rapture until Christ's second coming.  Also know as \"the time of Jacob's\n(Israel's) trouble\" (Jere 30:7) and \"Daniel's Seventieth Week\" (Dan 9), this \nperiod will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.\n\nIII. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM\n\n\tSoon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community \n(the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will\nbe tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable \npossession during the Tribulation.\n\nIV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tSince all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it\nis imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can\nquote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, \nRevelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to\nunfold before you.  \n\nV. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tPray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray \nand pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual \nstrength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the\nsake of Christ.  \n\nVI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED\nONES DIE AS MARTYRS\n\n\tAfter the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he\nwill institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell,\nor eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be\nuseless.  \"And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and \nslave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that\nno one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, \nor the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding\ncalculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number\nis 666\" - Revelation 13:16-18.  \n\tThe Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of \nhumanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed\nin the past, such as the Holocaust.\n[or maybe the crusades? -M]\nYou cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's\nrule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) \"...I saw\nunder the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and\nfor the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of \nthem: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, \nuntil both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be\nkilled as they were, was completed.\" Revelation 6:9, 11.\n\tHis targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image\nor take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ \"...And I saw the souls of \nthose who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of \nGod, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark\non their foreheads or on the hands.\" - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every\nform of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor\nwill he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, \ntorturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take\nthe mark.  \n\tIf you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,\nyou will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.\n[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]\nYou cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and\ngain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake\nof Fire.  \"...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his \nmark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of\nthe wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His \nindignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the \npresence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.\" -Revelation \n14:9-10 \n\n[and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to\nthe first 5,000 at the stadium --M] \n\nVII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL\n\n\tAlthough you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist's government\nuntil the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is \nimportant for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are\nextremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.\n\tThe first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or\nmountainous area, for the Antichrist's control will come last to the least\npopulated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay \nattuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.\n[\"As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep\ninto our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school\nclosings\" --M] \nStore water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without\nthe mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste\nfrom nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.\n[Get a good water filter. --M]\nBring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,\nbatteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to \nsurvive and live off the land as the pioneers did.\n\nVIII. TRUST NO ONE\n\t\n\tThere will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist's\ngovernment.  Be on the lookout.\n[Perot supporters take note --M]\n\nIX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST\n\n\tIt is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,\nfor he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will\nbring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel \n11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a\nhalf years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be \nphysically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and \npersonality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic\nexpert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which\nhe will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural \npower that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will\nbe deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.\n[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]\n\tThe antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who\nwill make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  \nAll who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and\na half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.\n\nX. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!\n\n\tThe seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of\nChrist.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you \nwill be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  \n\tStart reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of \nyour sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take\nthe mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or\nremain saved, but this time you will have to be \"faithful unto death.\"\n\n\tMay God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!\n\n******************************************************************************\nMike Cluff\t\t\t\t*  \"Christianity is Stupid.\nv22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms\t*   Give up.\" -Negativland\nUB Language Perception Laboratory\t*  \n******************************************************************************\n\n\n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\ \n\nBob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM \n\nThey said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,\nand sank Manhattan out at sea.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n", "title": "Example 94"}, {"text": "From: mam@mouse.cmhnet.org (Mike McAngus)\nSubject: Re: Americans and Evolution\nOrganization: The cat is on the mat \nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL9]\nLines: 53\n\nOn Tue, 20 Apr 1993 04:49:18 GMT bil@okcforum.osrhe.edu (Bill Conner) wrote:\n>Robert Singleton (bobs@thnext.mit.edu) wrote:\n\n>: > Sure it isn't mutually exclusive, but it lends weight to (i.e. increases\n>: > notional running estimates of the posterior probability of) the \n>: > atheist's pitch in the partition, and thus necessarily reduces the same \n>: > quantity in the theist's pitch.

Put another way, the question is whether homosexual\nintercourse is the only act that Christians are supposed to believe\nis immoral solely on the basis that God says it is, with no insight\nbeing offered as to *why* it is immoral. No one could answer my\nquestion in either form from the Bible. (I did get an interesting\nresponse based on Roman Catholic theology).\n\nHowever, I think now that I can at least answer my first question.\nLink Hudson pointed me to it in his recent comments about sleeping\nwith one's aunt. Incest is held to be immoral in every society,\nthat is, there are some degrees of relationship where marriage\n(and thus, intercouse) is prohibited. The Bible is no exception.\nThe trouble is that it may be difficult to see *why* a particular\nrelationship qualifies as incestuous. Societies differ as to\nhow they define incest. Genetic reasons are sometimes offered, but\nall the Biblical cases cannot be dealt with that way. Why can't\na man sleep with his step mother--assuming that his father is\ndead and that he has \"married\" her? How does this case differ\nfrom the *duty* to marry one's brother's childless wife.\n\nAre these two cases parallel? Does the Bible prohibit some incestuous\nmarriages and homosexual marriages for the same reason, perhaps\nthat God knows they are not good for us and yet we are incapable\nof understanding why.\n\nP.S. Please don't bother writing me to tell me that I am a homophobe,\nas some did last time. My mind is not made up on these questions.\nYou don't know whether I am homophobic or not. You don't\nknow me. To call me or anyone else a homophobe without knowing the\nperson may be as much an expression of bigotry as some homophobic\nremarks.\n-- \nStan Armstrong.

I do remember calling Christianity\n\"silly\" and then following that up with information that I was nine years\nold when I thought that. I also said that I find faith to be intellectually\ndishonest and I would like to see some sort of proof of your god's\nexistence.

What I have seen happening\nis my homosexual and/or friends being beat up, or preached at by people\nwho claim to be Christ's followers. I know that this sort of thing isn't\npracticed by the majority of Christians, but it is a very vocal minority\nwho are doing it and I don't see comperable victimization of Christians. \n\n>Now I have a question for Bob.

I'm not a\nstudent of psychology, BTW, but I am a student of Creative Writing and\nLinguistics, so literary analysis _is_ my forte. Also, if the implications\nI see are improper, please let me know.\nI'm here because I'm not sequestered in my own little atheist cubbyhole as\nyou seem to think atheists should be. Did it occur to you that I _don't_\nthink I know everything and that maybe someone will say something that\nwill change my life? Have you read my other posts here or did you see\n\"atheist\" and decide it was time to poke at someone who doesn't deserve\nyour respect?\nAw, geez. I'm sorry, I probably am getting my back up a little too high,\nhere. It's just that the \"nonsense\" thing really annoys me. I figure you\nshould see my first reactions, though, since they are my true reactions to\nyour question.\nNow, the smoothed feather version:\nI seek all sorts of knowledge. That's why I came to my university. Yes, I\nam looking at your religion (well, sorta, I have no idea what *kind* of\nChristian you are) from the outside, and hopefully with an objective view.\nI've been trying to ask reasoned questions here, because I genuinely don't\nknow the answers to them, but when I saw the question directed at atheists\nI figured I would answer. After all, you can speculate about atheist\nmotives here all you want (hence the \"amatuer\" psychology crack), but\nwithout an atheist, you can't be sure of even one atheist's motive.       \nI'm hoping people really\nwant to know and I was trying to show that I actually checked out several\nreligions and I actually read all the pamphlets people have to offer and I\nactually think about these things. Instead, I'm still faced with the\nimplication that atheism is some kind of aberration and that only \"broken\"\npeople are atheist.\n\tTry it from the flip side: I posit that atheism is the natural\nstate and only broken people are theists. I offer as proof that so many\npeople witness from horrible lives which picked up as soon as they \ndiscovered their religion, that religion is regional (if people didn't\nfollow the religion of their areas, there would be a more homogenous\nmix), so many terrorists claim theistic motives, and that theists tend\nto be so pushy and angry when challenged on alt.atheism. Why are religions\nso successful? Because there is so much suffering in the world, which \n\"breaks\" people.\nIt's an uncomfortable situation whichever way you look at it, which is another\nreason I'm here, to try to see the flip side of my thinking (and also as \na watchdog for logical fallacies :).\n>I have a \n>difficult enough time keeping up with it, and I think I know something\n                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n>about the subject.     \n ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nThe implication here being that atheists can't possibly know anything\nabout Christianity. Probably jumping at shadows again, but I think my\nreaction is somewhat justified. After all, the first post suggested that\natheists are \"broken\", hostile people. This post confirms that someone\nelse believes it. \n\n>\n>Bob reminds me of my roommate.  In order to disbelieve atheism, he says \n                                             ^^^^^^^^^^\n>he will need to be proven wrong about it. \n\nWell, he got me there. I am a strong atheist, because I feel that lack of\nevidence, especially about something like an omnipotent being, implies\nlack of existence. However, I haven't met the strong atheist yet who said\nthat nothing could ever persuade him. Call me a \"seeker\" if you like, I\ndon't. \n_Weak_ atheism is being ignore here, though. Some atheists simply say \"I\ndon't believe in any god\" rather than my position: \"I believe that no\ngod(s) exist.\" For the weak atheist, the is no atheism to disbelieve,\nbecause they don't actively believe in atheism. (If you think this is\nconfusing, try figuring out the difference between Protestants and\nMethodists from an atheist point of view :).\nThis is another fallacy many theists seem to have, that everyone believes in\nsomething (followed up by \"everyone has faith in something\"). Guess what?\nMy atheism ends the moment I'm shown a proof of some god's existence. Is\nthat really too much to ask?\n\n\n>Well, I don't even waste my time trying. \n\nWell, I guess you won't succeed in converting him or me. Why the\nsupposition that you will fail to convince him?

Maybe that's how I'm \"broken\"?\nI tell you that I have invisible fairies living in my garden and that\nyou should just take my word for it. If you accept that, you are of a\nfundamentally different mind than I and I really would like to know how you\nthink. All I ask for is proof of the assertion \"God exists\".

She said\nthat when she and my father were raising we four children, they\ndid not try to raise us in this world as strictly as they were raised\nin their Norwegian Lutheran community. They felt that we would be\nalienated from them and it would create problems.\n  In other words, my parent did the very tolerant, loving thing. They\nraised us without conflict, without what we saw as unreasonable\ndemands and were always accepting, no matter what the circumstances.\n  What happened was that I grew up believing in situation ethics and\nnever absolutes. I believed in a loving God, and my concept of God\nnever involved justice or punishment, nor was there any concept that\nI may someday be held responsible for the things that offended\nHim...sins that the \"world\" told me were OK.\n  My parents are very good, honest and moral people. They raised\nfour extremely honest children. Yet, before coming to a more\ncomplete knowledge of God (which includes the knowledge of justice\nand punishment)I committed what I now believe to be many, many\ngrave sins. I lived with a partner outside of marriage, was married\nand divorced ( only after physical abuse and no apparent hope for\nchange...but I shouldn't have married to person in the first place )\nand more....\n  My parents felt they were doing the loving,kind thing by allowing\nus to be who we were, by not imposing their standards on us, and by\naccepting unquestioningly everything we did without judgement or\ncounsel.\n  Today, it is absolutely appalling for me to look back on what they\n*did* accept without a word. It takes courages to dare to help souls\nbecause you must speak up and say what is unpopular and\ndifficult and what people do not want to hear. You must be able\nto say what is hard, and say it as Christ would, with love and\ncompassion. It involves risk....perhaps someone you love may not\nwant to hear and will stay away from you.\n  This life is \"but dust\". As long as the comfort of this life\nis our highest priority, we will fail God and fail those\nwith whom we come in contact.\n  I wonder how many who engage in sex outside of marriage, who\nsupport the \"right\" to abortion, who engage in homosexuality,\nor who commit any of the range of sins that are plentiful in\nthis time have ever heard from a quiet, thoughtful, loving\nfriend that these things are *wrong*. No one ever told me that\nwhat I was doing was wrong, and I saw multitudes around me\nliving the same way I was and they seemed like good, decent\npeople.

Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short \nstories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.\nHe wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than\ntechnology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he\nremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:\n\n\"Galactic Pot-Healer\"\nA fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a\nremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the\ndeity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is\nunable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.\n\n\"A Maze of Death\"\nNoteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.\n\n\"VALIS\"\nThe schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic\nChristianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of\nunknown but possibly divine origin.

Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be\nassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.\n\nMARGARET ATWOOD\n\n\"The Handmaid's Tale\"\nA story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously\nassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it\n\"right\" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live\nunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked,\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\nretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \"old world\" are\nhunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to\nat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.\n\nVARIOUS AUTHORS\n\n\"The Bible\"\nThis somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it\nis probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is\nabout.

In this\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\ndecisively rejected in Mackie's \"The Miracle of Theism\".  In the revised\nedition of \"The Existence of God\", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he\nmakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.\n\nJ. L. MACKIE\n\n\"The Miracle of Theism\", Oxford\nThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal\narguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical\nphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through\nthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements\nof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \"replacements for\nGod\" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less\nformalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly direct\nwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.\n\nJAMES A.

Since authority is a matter of both\ncommunicator and recepiant we can say that, for example \"Jesus\nis Lord\" whether the world at large accepts the authority or\nnot. Thus the Bible can be considered for its authoritative\ncontent whether or not it is accepted (This issue is at the\nheart of Pilate's pragmatic question \"What is truth?\" to Jesus\nwhen our Lord was brought before Him. Jesus' reply was to appeal\nto the authority of his Father)\nYou also might like to consider the claimed authority\nrepresented by the statements \"thus says the Lord\" in the Bible,\nwhich claim to put across the exact words of God.\n\nYou fall into the danger of relativism with your rejection of\ninherant authority and claim that it lies only in the \"community\nof faith\" - does something become truth because it is accepted?\nThe main thrust of my argument is that there is a Godward\ndirection as well as a manward (which is where the reference to\nRev 22 came in.)\n\n>: 2.

Put another way, the question is whether homosexual\nintercourse is the only act that Christians are supposed to believe\nis immoral solely on the basis that God says it is, with no insight\nbeing offered as to *why* it is immoral. No one could answer my\nquestion in either form from the Bible. (I did get an interesting\nresponse based on Roman Catholic theology).\n\nHowever, I think now that I can at least answer my first question.\nLink Hudson pointed me to it in his recent comments about sleeping\nwith one's aunt. Incest is held to be immoral in every society,\nthat is, there are some degrees of relationship where marriage\n(and thus, intercouse) is prohibited. The Bible is no exception.\nThe trouble is that it may be difficult to see *why* a particular\nrelationship qualifies as incestuous. Societies differ as to\nhow they define incest. Genetic reasons are sometimes offered, but\nall the Biblical cases cannot be dealt with that way. Why can't\na man sleep with his step mother--assuming that his father is\ndead and that he has \"married\" her? How does this case differ\nfrom the *duty* to marry one's brother's childless wife.\n\nAre these two cases parallel? Does the Bible prohibit some incestuous\nmarriages and homosexual marriages for the same reason, perhaps\nthat God knows they are not good for us and yet we are incapable\nof understanding why.\n\nP.S. Please don't bother writing me to tell me that I am a homophobe,\nas some did last time. My mind is not made up on these questions.\nYou don't know whether I am homophobic or not. You don't\nknow me. To call me or anyone else a homophobe without knowing the\nperson may be as much an expression of bigotry as some homophobic\nremarks.\n-- \nStan Armstrong.

I do remember calling Christianity\n\"silly\" and then following that up with information that I was nine years\nold when I thought that. I also said that I find faith to be intellectually\ndishonest and I would like to see some sort of proof of your god's\nexistence. I define \"faith\" as \"belief in the absense of any proof\", BTW.\n\nAlso, I subscribe to a.a as I mentioned and we see fundies of all types\nthere, so in answer to your question: \"no.\"\n\nFinally, I'd hardly call Christianity \"beseiged\" in this country. I seldom\nsee Christians ridiculed for merely practising their religion or wearing\ncrosses or having Christian bumper stickers. I don't know for sure, of\ncourse, I only say I haven't seen it happening. What I have seen happening\nis my homosexual and/or friends being beat up, or preached at by people\nwho claim to be Christ's followers. I know that this sort of thing isn't\npracticed by the majority of Christians, but it is a very vocal minority\nwho are doing it and I don't see comperable victimization of Christians. \n\n>Now I have a question for Bob.  Why in the world would any self-respecting\n>atheist want to subscribe to a Christian news group?  \n\nThe implication being that I am not self-respecting, of course.

Did it occur to you that I _don't_\nthink I know everything and that maybe someone will say something that\nwill change my life? Have you read my other posts here or did you see\n\"atheist\" and decide it was time to poke at someone who doesn't deserve\nyour respect?\nAw, geez. I'm sorry, I probably am getting my back up a little too high,\nhere. It's just that the \"nonsense\" thing really annoys me. I figure you\nshould see my first reactions, though, since they are my true reactions to\nyour question.\nNow, the smoothed feather version:\nI seek all sorts of knowledge. That's why I came to my university. Yes, I\nam looking at your religion (well, sorta, I have no idea what *kind* of\nChristian you are) from the outside, and hopefully with an objective view.\nI've been trying to ask reasoned questions here, because I genuinely don't\nknow the answers to them, but when I saw the question directed at atheists\nI figured I would answer. After all, you can speculate about atheist\nmotives here all you want (hence the \"amatuer\" psychology crack), but\nwithout an atheist, you can't be sure of even one atheist's motive.       \nI'm hoping people really\nwant to know and I was trying to show that I actually checked out several\nreligions and I actually read all the pamphlets people have to offer and I\nactually think about these things. Instead, I'm still faced with the\nimplication that atheism is some kind of aberration and that only \"broken\"\npeople are atheist.\n\tTry it from the flip side: I posit that atheism is the natural\nstate and only broken people are theists. I offer as proof that so many\npeople witness from horrible lives which picked up as soon as they \ndiscovered their religion, that religion is regional (if people didn't\nfollow the religion of their areas, there would be a more homogenous\nmix), so many terrorists claim theistic motives, and that theists tend\nto be so pushy and angry when challenged on alt.atheism. Why are religions\nso successful? Because there is so much suffering in the world, which \n\"breaks\" people.\nIt's an uncomfortable situation whichever way you look at it, which is another\nreason I'm here, to try to see the flip side of my thinking (and also as \na watchdog for logical fallacies :).\n>I have a \n>difficult enough time keeping up with it, and I think I know something\n                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n>about the subject.     \n ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nThe implication here being that atheists can't possibly know anything\nabout Christianity. Probably jumping at shadows again, but I think my\nreaction is somewhat justified. After all, the first post suggested that\natheists are \"broken\", hostile people. This post confirms that someone\nelse believes it. \n\n>\n>Bob reminds me of my roommate.  In order to disbelieve atheism, he says \n                                             ^^^^^^^^^^\n>he will need to be proven wrong about it. \n\nWell, he got me there. I am a strong atheist, because I feel that lack of\nevidence, especially about something like an omnipotent being, implies\nlack of existence. However, I haven't met the strong atheist yet who said\nthat nothing could ever persuade him. Call me a \"seeker\" if you like, I\ndon't. \n_Weak_ atheism is being ignore here, though. Some atheists simply say \"I\ndon't believe in any god\" rather than my position: \"I believe that no\ngod(s) exist.\" For the weak atheist, the is no atheism to disbelieve,\nbecause they don't actively believe in atheism. (If you think this is\nconfusing, try figuring out the difference between Protestants and\nMethodists from an atheist point of view :).\nThis is another fallacy many theists seem to have, that everyone believes in\nsomething (followed up by \"everyone has faith in something\"). Guess what?\nMy atheism ends the moment I'm shown a proof of some god's existence. Is\nthat really too much to ask?\n\n\n>Well, I don't even waste my time trying. \n\nWell, I guess you won't succeed in converting him or me. Why the\nsupposition that you will fail to convince him? (amatuer psycology on) Is\nit because you yourself are unconvinced? :) \n\n> I tell him that he'll just have to take my word for it.\nAnd I told you that I find faith to be intellectually dishonest. Note that\nI can only speak for myself. If you find faith to be honest, show me how.\nI have been unable to reconcile it so far. Maybe that's how I'm \"broken\"?\nI tell you that I have invisible fairies living in my garden and that\nyou should just take my word for it. If you accept that, you are of a\nfundamentally different mind than I and I really would like to know how you\nthink. All I ask for is proof of the assertion \"God exists\". Logical or\nphysical proofs only, please. Then we'll discuss the nature of \"God\".\n\n>In response, he tells me he will say an \"atheist's prayer\" for me. \nPrayer?! Uh, oh, we'll have to revoke his atheist club card and beanie! :)\n\n>Good luck, Bob.  And, best regards.\n\nGood luck to you, as well. And, again, I apologize if the inferences I\nmade were inaccurate. \n\n>-- \n>Randal Lee Nicholas Mandock \n>Catechist\n>gt7122b@prism.gatech.edu \n\nMuppets and garlic toast forever,\nMax (Bob) Muir\n\n\n[Note that abbreviation of quoted pasages is not always the fault\nof the poster.

The founder of this\nmovement, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), was proclaimed to \nbe the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in the Scriptures\nof almost all major religions of the world. He claimed to be the \nfulfillment of the long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ\n(metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah.\n\n        The claims of Hazrat Ahmad raised storms of hostility and\nextreme opposition, which are often witnessed in the history of \ndivine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted especial-\nly in some of the Muslim regimes. The right of Ahmadi Muslims to \nopenly practice their religion and to define themselves as Muslims\nhas been severely restricted in many Muslim Countries. The United\nNations, human rights organizations such as Amnesty International\nand top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns \nagainst this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the\nmembers of this movement, but so far to no avail.\n\n        Despite the opposition and persecution, the movement cont-\ninues to grow with a current membership of millions from around the\nworld in over 130 countries, who come from diverse ethnic and cul-\ntural backgrounds.\n\n        The movement is devoted to world peace and strives towards\ndeveloping a better understanding of all religions. Ahmadi Muslims\nhave always been opposed to all forms of violence, bigotry, reli-\ngious intolerance and fundamentalism.\n\n        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-\ntablished a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clinics\nin many third world countries. These institutions are staffed by\nvolunteer professionals and are fully financed by the movement's\ninternal resources. The movement stresses the importance of educa-\ntion and leadership. Its members have included a high number of\nprofessionals as well as world class individuals.\n\n        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral\nreform, establish peace and justice, and to unite mankind under\none universal brotherhood.\n\n\nNEWSGROUP CREATION: \n==================\n\n        The  discussion for this proposed newsgroup has now offi-\ncially ended. Voting will be held for three weeks. If the news-\ngroup gets 2/3rd majority AND 100 more \"YES/Create\" votes than\n\"NO/don't create\" votes; the newsgroup shall be created. \n\n\nABOUT THE VOTE-TAKER: \n====================\n\n        Mr. Anthony Lest has been asked by the proponents of\nthis newsgroup to act as an official impartial vote-taker for the\nproposed newsgroup. He has no objection to  use his workstation\nfor the purpose of vote-taking. Neither the University of Colora-\ndo, nor Anthony Lest has anything to do with the proposal of the\nnewsgroup.  They are just collecting the votes as a neutral third\nparty.\n\nQUESTIONS OR COMMENTS:\n=====================\n\n        Any questions or comments about the proposed newsgroup\nmay be sent to:\n     Nabeel A.

As for the four gospels being in harmony\non the issue of Jesus...  You know not of what you speak.  Here are a few\ncontradictions starting with the trial and continuing through the assension.\n\n>The death of Judas after the betrayal of Jesus\n\nActs 1:18: \"Now this man (Judas) purchased a field with the reward of \niniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his \nbowels gushed out.\"\n\nMatt. 27:5-7: \"And he (Judas) cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, \nand departed, and went and hanged himself.  And the chief priests...bought \nwith them the potter's field.\"\n\n>What was Jesus' prediction regarding Peter's denial?\n\nBefore the cock crow - Matthew 26:34\n\nBefore the cock crow twice - Mark 14:30\n\n>How many times did the cock crow?\n\nMAR 14:72  And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind  the \nword  that  Jesus  said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny\nme thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.\n\nMAT 26:74  Then began he to curse and to swear,  saying,  I  know not the man.\nAnd immediately the cock crew.\nMAT 26:75  And Peter remembered the word  of  Jesus,  which  said unto him,\nBefore the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept\nbitterly.\n\nLUK 22:60  And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest.  And immediately,\nwhile he yet spake, the cock crew.\nLUK 22:61  And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And  Peter remembered\nthe word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou\nshalt deny me thrice.\n\nJOH 13:38  Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? \nVerily,\n verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, still thou hast denied me\nthrice.\n\nJOH 18:27  Peter then denied  again:  and  immediately  the  cock crew.\n\n>destruction of cities (what said was jeremiah was zechariah)\n\n(This is interesting because Matthew quotes a prophesy that was never made! \nNot the only time he does this either...)\n\nMAT 27:9  Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy  the prophet, \nsaying,  And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was\nvalued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;\n\nzechariah 11:11-13\n(nothing in Jeremiah remotely like)\n\nWhat was the color of the robe placed on Jesus during his trial?\n\nscarlet - Matthew 27:28\n\npurple John 19:2\n\n>The time of the Crucifiction\n\nMark says the third hour, or 9 a.m., but John says the sixth hour (noon) was\nwhen the sentence was passed.\n\n>Inscription on the Cross\n\nMatthew  --  This is Jesus the king of the Jews\nMark\t --  The King of the Jews\nLuke\t --  This is the king of the Jews\nJohn\t --  Jesus of Nazareth the king of the Jews\n\n>What did they give him to drink?\n\nvinegar - Matthew 27:34\n\nwine with myrrh - Mark 15:23\n\n>Women at the Cross\n\nMatthew said many stood far off, including Mary Magdaline, Mary the mother of\nJames, and the mother of Zebedee's children.  Mark and Luke speak of many far\noff, and Mark includes Mary Magdeline and Mary the mother of James the less.\nJohn says that Jesus's mother stood at the cross, along with her sister and\nMary Magdalene.\n\n>Jesus' last words \n\nMatt.27:46,50: \"And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, \nsaying, \"Eli, eli, lama sabachthani?\" that is to say, \"My God, my God, why\nhast thou forsaken me?\"  ...Jesus, when he cried again with a loud voice,\nyielded u the ghost.\"\n\nLuke23:46: \"And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, \"Father, unto\n thy hands I commend my spirit:\" and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.\"\n\nJohn19:30: \"When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, \"It is \nfinished:\" and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.\"\n\n>Events of the crucifiction\n\nMatthew says that the veil of the temple was rent, that there was an\nearthquake, and that it was dark from the sixth to the ninth hour, that graves\nopened and bodies of the saints arose and went into Jeruselem, appearing to\nmany (beating Jesus to the resurection). Mark and Luke speak of darkness and\nthe veil of the temple being rent but mention no earthquake or risen saints. \nJohn is the only one who mentions Jesus's side being peirced.\n\n>Burial of Jesus\n\nMatthew says the Jews asked Pilate for a guard to prevent the body from being\nstolen by the disciples, and for the tomb to be sealed. All of this was\nsupposedly done, but the other gospels do not mention these precautions.\n\n>How long was Jesus in the tomb?\nDepends where you look; Matthew 12:40 gives Jesus prophesying that he will\nspend \"three days and three nights in the heart of the earth\", and Mark 10:34\nhas \"after three days (meta treis emeras) he will rise again\". As far as I can\nsee from a quick look, the prophecies have \"after three days\", but the\npost-resurrection narratives have \"on the third day\".\n\n>Time of the Resurection\n\nMatthew says Sunday at dawn, Mark says the sun was rising, and John says it\nwas dark.\n\n> Who was at the Empty Tomb?  Is it :\n\nMAT 28:1  In the end of the sabbath, as it began to  dawn  toward the first\nday of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.\n\nMAR 16:1  And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the  mother \nof  James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and\nanoint him.\n\nJOH 20:1  The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene  early, when  it \nwas  yet  dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the\nsepulchre.\n\n>Whom did they see at the tomb?\n\nMAT 28:2  And, behold, there was  a  great  earthquake:  for  the angel of the\nLord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door,\nand sat upon it.\nMAT 28:3  His countenance was like  lightning,  and  his  raiment white as\nsnow: MAT 28:4  And for fear of him the keepers did shake,  and  became as\ndead men. MAT 28:5  And the angel answered and said unto  the  women,  Fear\nnot ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.\n\nMAR 16:5  And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a  young  man sitting  on \nthe right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.\n\nLUK 24:4  And it came  to  pass,  as  they  were  much  perplexed thereabout,\nbehold, two men stood by them in shining garments:\n\nJOH 20:12  And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at  the head,  and \nthe  other  at  the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.\n\n>Belief that the disciples stole Jesus's body\n\nMatthew says the guard was paid to tell this story, but no other gospel makes\nthis claim.\n\n>Appearences of the risen Jesus\n\nMatthew says an angel at the tomb told the two Marys and that Jesus also told\nthem, to tell the disciples to meet him in Galilee.  The disciples then went\nto a mountain previously agreed opon, and met Jesus there.  This was his only\nappearance, except to the women at the tomb.  Matthew only devotes five verses\nto the visit with the disciples.\n\nMark says that Jesus walked with two of the disciples in the country, and that\nthey told the rest of the disciples, who refused to believe.  Later he\nappeared to the 11 disciples at mealtime.\n\nLuke says two followers went, the same day that Jesus rose from the dead, to\nEmmaus, a village eight miles from Jeruselem, and there Jesus jioned them but\nwas unrecognised.  While they ate a meal together that evening, they finally\nrecognised Jesus, whereopon he dissapeared.  Returning at once to Jeruselem,\nthey told the\ndisciples of their experience, and suddenly Jesus appeared among them,\nfrightening them, as they thought he was a spirit.  Jesus then ate some fish\nand honey and then preached to them.\n\nJohn says Jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he arrose, in\nJeruselem, where they were hiding.  He breathed the Holy Ghost opon them, but\nThomas was not present and refused to believe. Eight days later Jesus joined\nthe disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced Thomas.\tOnce\nmore Jesus made an\nappearance to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias but again was not\nrecognised.\n After telling them to cast their netson the other side of the boat, Jesus\nbecomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them.  They all eat\ntogether and converse.\n\nThe book of acts further adds to the confusion.  It says that Jesus showed\nhimself to the apostles for a period of 40 days after his resurection (thus\ncontradicting Matthew, Mark, Luke AND John) and spoke to them of things\npertaining to the kingdom of God: \"And when he had spoken these things, while\nthey beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud recieved him out of their sight. \nAnd while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, two men stood\nby them in white apparel: Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye\ngazing into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken from you into heaven,\nshall so comein like manneras ye have seen him go into heaven\" Acts 1:3-11\n\nPaul outdoes every other \"authority\" by saying that Jesus was seen by 500\npersons between the time of the resurection and the\nassension, although he does not say where.\tHe also claims that he himself \"as\none born out of due time\" also saw Jesus. 1 Cor 15:6-8.\n\n>The Ascension\n\nMatthew says nothing about it.\tMark casually says that Jesus was recieved into\nheaven after he was finished talking with the\ndisciples in Jeruselem.  Luke says Jesus led the desciples to Bethany and that\nwhile he blessed them, he was parted from them and carried up into heaven. \nJohn says nothing about it.  Acts\ncontradicts all of the above.  (See previous section)\n\n>When second coming?\n\nMAT 24:34  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all\nthese things be fulfilled.\n\nMAR 13:30  Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall  not pass, till\nall these things be done.\n\nLUK 21:32  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not  pass away, till\nall be fulfilled.\n\n1 thessalonians 4:15-18\n\n>How many apostles were in office between the resurection and ascention \n1 Corinthians 15:5 (12)\nMatthew 27:3-5 (minus one from 12)\nActs 1:9-26 (Mathias not elected until after resurrection)\nMAT 28:16  Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain\nwhere Jesus had appointed them.\n\n> ascend to heaven\n\t\"And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.\" (2 Kings 2:11)\n\n\t\"No man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven, \t...\nthe Son of Man.\" (John 3:13)\n\nAs you can see, there are a number of contradictions in the account of the\ntrial, crucifiction and resurection of Jesus.  If these are good witnesses,\nyou would think that they could get SOME of these important details right! \n(In fact, I cannot find very many points on where they AGREE.

Since authority is a matter of both\ncommunicator and recepiant we can say that, for example \"Jesus\nis Lord\" whether the world at large accepts the authority or\nnot. Thus the Bible can be considered for its authoritative\ncontent whether or not it is accepted (This issue is at the\nheart of Pilate's pragmatic question \"What is truth?\" to Jesus\nwhen our Lord was brought before Him. Jesus' reply was to appeal\nto the authority of his Father)\nYou also might like to consider the claimed authority\nrepresented by the statements \"thus says the Lord\" in the Bible,\nwhich claim to put across the exact words of God.\n\nYou fall into the danger of relativism with your rejection of\ninherant authority and claim that it lies only in the \"community\nof faith\" - does something become truth because it is accepted?\nThe main thrust of my argument is that there is a Godward\ndirection as well as a manward (which is where the reference to\nRev 22 came in.)\n\n>: 2. Is it prophetic?\n>\n>How is \"prophecy\" to be defined? If it is \"speaking forth\" of God's message,\n>much of the apocrypha must surely qualify.\n\nIf we narrowed it down to the predictive elements - which will\ncut out some of the 39 accepted OT books as well - we\nnonetheless have criteria for determining the validity of the\nbook: Jesus' standards were that \"Scripture cannot be broken\".\nCan you name a single prophecy that fits the bill in the Apocrapha?\n(ie definitely fulfilled AFTER it has been written)\n\n>: 3. Is it authentic?\n>\n>Again, by what standard?

Many of the apocryphal books are highly\n>\"dynamic\" -thought provoking, faithful, even exciting.\n\nWhat this is getting at is the relationship between text and\nreader. It is to do with the quality of writing, which should\nhave the ability to fire the mind, affect our thought life and\ncause us to act in a certain way - there is something of this\nin Jesus' quote: \"Man does not live by bread alone, but by every\nword that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord\". (Matt 4.4)\n\n>: 5. Is it received, collected, read and used?\n>\n>By whom?  Of course the apocryphal books were received (by some),\n>collected (or else we would not have them), read and used (and they still are,\n>in the Catholic and Orthodox churches).\n\nDoes the Catholic Church give the same authority to the\nApocrapha as to the accepted 66 books? Certainly it is not as\nwidely used as the OT and NT.\n\n>: On these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God.\n>\n>This is demonstrably false.\n\nThink about what I have said above. You may want to revise your\nconclusion. In addition think about other 'sacred writings', eg\nthe Koran, the book of Mormon and how and why you would\ncategorise them using the above principles. One word of caution\n- you may find some 'reflected glory' in some of these books: in\nthat the 'inspired quality' may be derived from the Bible.\nRemember that Lucifer is quite capable of appearing as an angel\nof light and quoting Scripture.\n\n>: To quote Unger's Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha:\n>: 1.

Put another way, the question is whether homosexual\nintercourse is the only act that Christians are supposed to believe\nis immoral solely on the basis that God says it is, with no insight\nbeing offered as to *why* it is immoral. No one could answer my\nquestion in either form from the Bible.

Incest is held to be immoral in every society,\nthat is, there are some degrees of relationship where marriage\n(and thus, intercouse) is prohibited. The Bible is no exception.\nThe trouble is that it may be difficult to see *why* a particular\nrelationship qualifies as incestuous. Societies differ as to\nhow they define incest. Genetic reasons are sometimes offered, but\nall the Biblical cases cannot be dealt with that way. Why can't\na man sleep with his step mother--assuming that his father is\ndead and that he has \"married\" her? How does this case differ\nfrom the *duty* to marry one's brother's childless wife.\n\nAre these two cases parallel? Does the Bible prohibit some incestuous\nmarriages and homosexual marriages for the same reason, perhaps\nthat God knows they are not good for us and yet we are incapable\nof understanding why.\n\nP.S.

The following is a survey directed towards all readers of this\ngroup, intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief.  I would\nseriously appreciate it if each and every one of you would fill it out and\nmail it back to me at mtabbott@unix.amherst.edu.  \n\nFirst of all, I've tried to structure questions that can be answered in a\nvariety of ways, with varying amounts of detail; it's possible to give \nsuccinct answers to most everything, but there's enough here to keep most of \nyou typing for hours, I'm sure.  As much detail as you want to give me (I mean \nit) is great, but it's also important for me to have as broad a base of \nindividuals as possible, so even minimal responses are far better than nothing\n-- it's a short survey if you just answer the questions without elaboration.  \n\nSecondly, I hope some of the questions don't come off as obnoxious; I know that\nphrases like \"What would convince you of the existence of God\" imply that I am\na seminary student intent on proving you all to be ignorant Godless heathens.\nIn fact, I'm not too sure about the existence of a higher power myself, so my\nuse of \"God\" is a question of locution rather than ideology -- it's easier \nthan just repeating \"a deity or higher power\" every time.  \n\nAlso, I tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like \"belief system\"\nalthough I know some of you might contend that you don't have ANY beliefs, but\nare skeptical towards everything.  I understand; but you know what I mean.\nThink of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases \nrequired to get the precise idea across.  \n\nLastly, thanks!  Please fill out as much as you can, in as much detail as\nyou can, and send them to me.  My research and I thank you.  \n\n---------------\n\nWhere would you place your beliefs, on the spectrum \n\tTheism <--> Agnosticism <--> Weak Atheism <--> Strong Atheism?  \nFeel free to elaborate on your specific beliefs.  \n\n\nIn what, if any, religious tradition were you raised?  Did you ever believe \nin the existence of a God?  (Several of the following questions presume \nthat the answer to this is \"yes;\" if you've always been an atheist, or at\nleast never a theist, you may have to modify the question/answer somewhat.)\n\n\nHow serious was your/your family's involvement?  \n\nHow and when did you start to doubt the tenets you were raised to believe?  \n\nHow and when did your \"final break\" with your beliefs, if any, occur?  I \nrealize that this is often more of an ongoing process than an \"event\" per se;\nwhatever the case, just describe it in whatever detail you wish.  \n\n\nWhat contact with other atheists have you had; before and after (and during)\nyour \"conversion\" to atheism?  (Certainly your involvement with alt.atheism\ncounts -- how have net discussions affected your beliefs?)  \n\nTo what extent do you think other atheists have influenced you in your\nbeliefs?  Did you come by your beliefs through discussion, through\nindependent means, or by some combination of the two or other means?  \n\n\nAre you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational\nmeans (proofs of the non-existence of God, etc), or was it perhaps, at least \nin part, through other means (alienation from mainstream religion, etc)?  \n\n\nTo what extent do you feel you \"understand\" the universe through your beliefs?\nWhat phenomena of the universe and of human existence (anything from physical\nphenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs) do you \nfeel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs, and where are they lacking as \nan explanatory method?  \n\nWhat would it take for you to question, or change, your beliefs?  What would\nconvince you of the existence of God, what would convince you of the \nplausibility of God's existence, and so forth?  How dynamic are your beliefs\n-- are they constantly changing; have they stayed more or less the same for\nsome time?  \n\nAre you involved in a career or education in science?  To what extent do you\nthink science has influenced your beliefs?  (Issac Asimov claimed that science\nwas the new \"secular religion,\" and that \"scientists are, in a very real sense,\nthe new priesthood.\"  Do you see the pursuit of science as having a quasi-\nreligious base, or even a religious element?)  \n\n---------------\n\nThis survey is intended to get data from a broad range of individuals, but\nalso to help me narrow down the field to a small group of people whose\nideas and histories could be very useful to me.  Would you be willing to have\nme, on the basis of this survey, write you to find out more about you and your\nbeliefs?  If not, fine; your filling out the survey alone is great.  \n\n---------------\n\nThanks again.  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about what\nI'm doing with this data, or if you have anything to say in addition to what\nI've asked about above.  \n\n\tMark Abbott\n\tmtabbott@unix.amherst.ed\n", "title": "Example 469"}]}}

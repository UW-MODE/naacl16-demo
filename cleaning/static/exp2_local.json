He stated that God is not <br />&gt;necessarily a religious term, but could be used as other scientific terms that<br />&gt;give explanation for events or theories, without being a proven scientific <br />&gt;fact.<br /><br />\tIt depends on how he defines God. The way I understand the meaning<br />of that term preclues it being used in a useful way in science. Ideas drawn<br />from an understanding that God is supernatural precludes us from forming<br />scientific assertions that can be falsified, that is, where we can decide<br />that they are true or false within the terms of we use and useful observations<br />drawn from them.<br /><br />\tSome religionists have an interest in bluring the definitions within<br />science to make them more reconcilable, and especially subserviant in a basic<br />way, to religious dogma. This pursuit always fails.<br /><br />&gt;  I think I got his point -- I can quote the section if I'm being vague. <br />&gt;The examples he gave were quarks and continental plates.  Are there <br />&gt;explanations of science or parts of theories that are not measurable in and of<br />&gt;themselves, or can everything be quantified, measured, tested, etc.?  <br /><br />\tReconciliation of science with religion involves circumventing the<br />tendancy to claim that either pursuit can gain absolute or certian knowledge,<br />or that the domain of truth in each is fundementally limited in some way. It<br />gererally confurs the element of uncertainty and limitations to human knowledge<br />while allowing for the different concerns of these separate pursuits. Science<br />and religion ask different questions which have imperfect and provisional<br />answers, at best. Science is distinctly limited in where it can ask meaningful<br />questions. More questions can be posed than it can answer. At the basis of<br />sacred language is the place where words fail us and mere assertions disolve<br />in contradiction.<br /><br />Bruce Salem<br /><br /><br />", "exp": [["article", -0.12640992487357322], ["wrote", -0.069297946348712794], ["au", -0.062465891108053874], ["who", 0.040151264400799171], ["am", 0.038721210820057451]]}, "id": 4, "true_class": 0}, {"c1": {"predict_proba": [0.22314483693567869, 0.77685516306432145], "data": "From: ptrei@bistromath.mitre.org (Peter Trei)<br />Subject: Re: Athiests and Hell<br />Organization: The MITRE Corporation<br />Lines: 106<br /><br />In article &lt;May.13.02.27.26.1993.1411@geneva.rutgers.edu&gt; REXLEX@fnal.fnal.gov writes:<br />&gt;In article &lt;May.11.02.36.29.1993.28068@athos.rutgers.edu&gt;<br />&gt;ptrei@bistromath.mitre.org (Peter Trei) writes:<br />&gt;&gt;In article &lt;May.9.05.38.49.1993.27375@athos.rutgers.edu&gt; REXLEX@fnal.fnal.gov<br />&gt;writes:<br />&gt;&gt;[much deleted] <br />&gt;&gt;&gt;point today might be the Masons.

This dates right back <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span><br />the Constitutions of 1738, which cite Adam as the first Mason. I've<br />seen other claims which place Masonry among the Romans, Greeks, and<br />Egyptians, and Atlanteans.

What's your point?<br /><br />   This whole \"leopard skin\" business sounds bizarre.  I have not yet<br />gone through the Scottish Rite (which contains all of those \"higher<br />degrees\" anti-Masons get so excited about, and which was invented in<br />the 1750's), but I know enough people who have (and who are good<br />Christians), that I reject your claim.<br /><br />&gt;I'll stand by my statements.

I don't remember which one it is off of<br />&gt;the top of my head, but it basically goes like this: Jesus is talking with the<br />&gt;apostles and they ask him why the pharisees say that before the messiah can <br />&gt;come Elijah must first come. Jesus replies that Elijah has come, but they did <br />&gt;not recognize him. It then says that the apostles perceived that he was refering <br />&gt;to John the Baptist. This seems to me to clearly imply reincarnation.<br /><br />This was a popular belief in the Judaism of Jesus` time, that Elijah<br />would return again (as he had been taken in to heaven in a chariot and<br />did not actually die).  However Jesus was referring to John the<br />Baptist not in the sense that Elijah was reincarnated as John<br />(remember Elijah didn`t die) but that John was a similar prophet to<br />Elijah.  John was a fiery preacher, he wore sackcloth and wandered<br />rough through Israel preaching the coming kingdom.  The verses that<br />describe him (in Mark`s gospel) can be linked to OT references about<br />Elijah.

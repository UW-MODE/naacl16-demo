STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC<br /><br />\tYour natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span><br />panic.  But <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> get right<br />with <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">God</span> before the rapture, you could have, but you chose <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> wait.  Now your <br />only chance is <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> stay on this earth and <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> endure <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> the end of the <br />Tribulation.  \"But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be <br />saved.\" - Matthew 24:13<br /><br />II. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION<br /><br />\tThe Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of<br />the rapture until <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">Christ</span>'s second coming.  Also know as \"the time of Jacob's<br />(Israel's) trouble\" (Jere 30:7) and \"Daniel's Seventieth Week\" (Dan 9), this <br />period will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.<br /><br />III. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM<br /><br />\tSoon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community <br />(the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will<br />be tantamount <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable <br />possession during the Tribulation.<br /><br />IV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE<br /><br />\tSince all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it<br />is imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can<br />quote them.  It is especially important <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, <br />Revelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span><br />unfold before you.  <br /><br />V. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE<br /><br />\tPray until the power of <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">God</span> comes strongly upon you - pray and pray <br />and pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual <br />strength <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> be able <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> withstand the torture you may have <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> endure for the<br />sake of <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">Christ</span>.  <br /><br />VI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED<br />ONES DIE AS MARTYRS<br /><br />\tAfter the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he<br />will institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell,<br />or eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be<br />useless.  \"And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and <br />slave, <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that<br />no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, <br />or the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding<br />calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number<br />is 666\" - Revelation 13:16-18.  <br />\tThe Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of <br />humanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed<br />in the past, such as the Holocaust.<br />[or maybe the crusades? -M]<br /><span style=\"color: #d01c8b; font-weight:bold;\">You</span> cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's<br />rule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) \"...I saw<br />under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">God</span> and<br />for the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> each of <br />them: and it was said <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> them that they should rest a little while longer, <br />until both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be<br />killed as they were, was completed.\" Revelation 6:9, 11.<br />\tHis targets will be Jews and <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">Christians</span> who do not worship his image<br />or take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ \"...And I saw the souls of <br />those who had been beheaded for their witness <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">Jesus</span> and for the word of <br /><span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">God</span>, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark<br />on their foreheads or on the hands.\" - Revelation 20:4.  <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">He</span> will use every<br />form of torture and humiliation in order <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> force you <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> renounce <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">Christ</span>.  Nor<br />will he hesitate <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> use your loved ones against you, even your children, <br />torturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> take<br />the mark.  <br />\tIf you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,<br />you will be consigned <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.<br />[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]<br /><span style=\"color: #d01c8b; font-weight:bold;\">You</span> cannot be redeemed.  It is better <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> endure torture for a short while and<br />gain eternal life then [sic] <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake<br />of Fire.  \"...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his <br />mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of<br />the wrath of <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">God</span>, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His <br />indignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the <br />presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.\" -Revelation <br />14:9-10 <br /><br />[and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span><br />the first 5,000 at the stadium --M] <br /><br />VII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL<br /><br />\tAlthough you may not be able <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> hide from the Antichrist's government<br />until the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is <br />important for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are<br />extremely strong in <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">Christ</span> can suffer and die for His sake.<br />\tThe first <span style=\"color: #d01c8b; font-weight:bold;\">thing</span> <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> do is move out of the city and into a rural or<br />mountainous area, for the Antichrist's control will come last <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> the least<br />populated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay <br />attuned <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.<br />[\"As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep<br />into our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school<br />closings\" --M] <br />Store water and food, because you will not be able <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> purchase anything without<br />the mark.

TRUST NO ONE<br />\t<br />\tThere will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist's<br />government.  Be on the lookout.<br />[Perot supporters take note --M]<br /><br />IX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST<br /><br />\tIt is important <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> realize who the Antichrist is and what he is <span style=\"color: #d01c8b; font-weight:bold;\">up</span> <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span>,<br />for he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will<br />bring peace and prosperity <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel <br />11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a<br />half years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">He</span> will be <br />physically appealing, highly intelligent, with <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">Christ</span>-like charisma and <br />personality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic<br />expert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which<br />he will break after three and a half years.  <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">He</span> will have such supernatural <br />power that a mortal wound <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will<br />be deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.<br />[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]<br />\tThe antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who<br />will make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> speak.  <br />All who refuse <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and<br />a half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.<br /><br />X. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!<br /><br />\tThe seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of<br /><span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">Christ</span>.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you <br />will be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  <br />\tStart reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of <br />your sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take<br />the mark or worship the Antichrist.  <span style=\"color: #d01c8b; font-weight:bold;\">You</span> still have a chance <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> be saved or<br />remain saved, but this time you will have <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">to</span> be \"faithful unto death.\"<br /><br />\tMay <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">God</span> find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!<br /><br />******************************************************************************<br />Mike Cluff\t\t\t\t*  \"Christianity is Stupid.<br />v22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms\t*   Give <span style=\"color: #d01c8b; font-weight:bold;\">up</span>.\" -Negativland<br />UB Language Perception Laboratory\t*  <br />******************************************************************************<br /><br /><br />/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\ <br /><br />Bob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM <br /><br />They said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,<br />and sank Manhattan out at sea.<br /><br />^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br />", "exp": [["In", -0.11549717432928584], ["Christians", 0.090939463617253607], ["up", -0.081580013402183835], ["Christ", 0.080700355790665382], ["You", -0.078314111934056671], ["thing", -0.077042569394496663], ["to", 0.032649599187735773], ["He", 0.028656406888821821], ["Jesus", 0.026324389621297867], ["God", 0.02267905832691863]]}, "id": 94, "true_class": 0}, {"c1": {"predict_proba": [0.96102292629225516, 0.038977073707744891], "data": "From: mam@mouse.cmhnet.org (Mike McAngus)<br />Subject: Hard/Soft == Strong/Weak.

Not only did it use steel and other metals, but it had<br />&gt;lots of wars (very OT).  No one has ever found any metal swords or<br />&gt;and traces of a civilization other than the Native Americans.<br />&gt;<br />&gt;This is just one example.<br /><br />From _Free Inquiry_, Winter 83/84,  the following is an<br />introduction to the <span style=\"color: #d01c8b; font-weight:bold;\">article</span> \"Joseph Smith and the Book of<br />Mormon\", by George D. Smith.  The introduction is written by<br />Paul Kurtz. <br /><br />\tMormonism -- the Church of Jesus <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">Christ</span> of Latter-day Saints<br />\t-- claims a worldwide membership 5.2 million.  It is one of<br />\tthe world's fastest growing religions, with as many as<br />\t200,000 new converst in 1982 alone.  Because of the <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">church</span>'s<br />\taggressive missionary program, covering more than one<br />\thundred countries, it is spreading even to third world<br />\tcountries.<br />\t<br />\tMormonism is both puritanical in moral outlook and<br />\tevangelical in preachment.  The <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">church</span> is run along strict<br />\tauthoritarian lines.  Led by a president, who allegedly<br />\treceives revelations directly form God, and a group of<br />\ttwelve apostles who attempt to maintain orthodoxy in belief<br />\tand practice, the <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">church</span> is opposed to abortion,<br />\tpornography, sexual freedom, women's rights, and other, in<br />\tits view, immoral influences of secular society, and it<br />\tforbids the use of tobacco, alcohol, coffee, and tea.<br />\t<br />\tCentered in Salt Lake City, the <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">church</span> is extremely wealthy<br />\tand politically powerful in Utal and many other western<br />\tstates.  Among well-know present-day Mormons are Ezra Taft<br />\tBenson (former secretary of agriculture), the Osmond family,<br />\tthe Mariotts of the hotel empire, and a score of high-placed<br />\tgovernment officials.<br />\t<br />\tThe Mormon <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">church</span> was founded in western New York in 1830 by<br />\tJoseph Smith who claimed that by divine revelation be had<br />\tfound gold plates containing hieroglyphics buried on a hill<br />\tand that with the help of visits from the angel Moroni he<br />\thad been able to translate the writing into the _Book of<br />\tMormon_, the basis of Mormon belief.  This book, written \"by<br />\tthe commandment of God,\" claims that the ancient Hebrews<br />\tsettled in America about 600 B.C.E. and were the ancestors<br />\tof the American Indians.  Mormons believe that those who<br />\thave been baptized in the \"true <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">church</span>\" will be reunited<br />\tafter death and that deceased non-Mormon family members can<br />\tbe baptized by proxy and thus join their relatives in the<br />\thereafter.  Because of these beliefs, Mormons have been<br />\tconsidered outcasts by mainline Christian denominations and<br />\tas heretics by religious fundamentalists.<br />\t<br />\tJoseph Smith was a controversial figure in his day -- he was<br />\tboth worshiped as a saint and denounced as a fraud.  Because<br />\tof persecution he led his band of loyal followers from<br />\tPalmyra, New York, westward to Ohio and then to Illinois,<br />\twhere in 1844 he was shot to death by an agry mob.  Brigham<br />\tYoung, who reportedly had as many as eighty wives, took over<br />\tthe leadership of the <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">church</span> and led the Mormons further<br />\twestward, to found the new Zion in Salt Lake City. <br />\tFollowing the teachings of Joseph Smith in the practice of<br />\tpolygamy was perhaps the Mormons most controversial practice<br />\tin nineteenth-century America.<br />\t<br />\tWhile other religions go back many centuries --<br />\tMuhammadanism, 1200 years; Christianity, 2000; and Judaism,<br />\t3000 -- and attempts to examine their beginnings are<br />\tdifficult, extensive historical investigation of Mormon<br />\troots is possible.  Some Mormons are willing to examine this<br />\thistory objectively, bu others maintain that such scrutiny<br />\tis dangerous to the faith.<br />\t<br />\t<span style=\"color: #d01c8b; font-weight:bold;\">In</span> the following pages, _Free Inquiry_ presents two articles<br />\tabout the Mormon <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">church</span>.

Second, we present a portion<br />\tof an interview with philosopher Sterling McMurrin, also a<br />\tMormon since birth, who questions the treatment of the<br />\thistory of the <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">church</span> by Mormon authorities. -- Paul Kurtz<br />\t<br /><br />The <span style=\"color: #d01c8b; font-weight:bold;\">article</span> itself is super.<br /><br />  ,...,.,,<br /> /666;    ',    <br />////;    _~ -   <br />(/@/----0-~-0<br /> ;'  . `` ~ \\'<br />  , `    ' , &gt;<br />;;|\\..((   -C----&gt;&gt; jimtims p00168@psilink.com <br />;;| &gt;-  `.__),;;<br /><br />", "exp": [["Posting", -0.18140297460800725], ["Host", -0.16617238940373341], ["article", -0.13354078843226849], ["Re", -0.13268534454716821], ["In", -0.12270548736313545], ["Nntp", -0.08825166488232912], ["Christ", 0.0854822978726857], ["EDU", -0.073503513102855966], ["12", -0.067188847425965786], ["church", 0.036724960588436661]]}, "id": 641, "true_class": 0}, {"c1": {"predict_proba": [0.99900616757732841, 0.00099383242267150006], "data": "From: mathew &lt;mathew@mantis.<span style=\"color: #d01c8b; font-weight:bold;\">co</span>.<span style=\"color: #d01c8b; font-weight:bold;\">uk</span>&gt;<br />Subject: <span style=\"color: #d01c8b; font-weight:bold;\">Re</span>: Cults Vs.

Although some forms of execution are painful (the electric<br />&gt;&gt;chair looks particularly so), I think the pain is relatively short-lived.<br />&gt;&gt;Drawing and quartering, on the other hand, looks very painful, and the<br />&gt;&gt;victim wouldn't die right away (he'd bleed to death, I'd imagine).<br />&gt;Ah, so a cruel punishment is not just if it is painful, as you <br />&gt;origionally stated. It is about long term pain, eg: non short-lived.<br />&gt;Why this sudden chance in your stance?<br /><br />I don't think I've changed my stance at all.  My original stance was that<br />a painless execution was not a cruel one.  I didn't say what would be<br />considered cruel, only that a painless death wasn't.  Now, cruelty must<br />involve some sort of suffering, I believe.  I don't think someone that gets<br />shot in the head or electrocuted really suffers very much.  Even a hanging<br />probably produces one sharp instance of pain, but it's over so quickly...<br /><br />&gt;Hmmmmm?<br /><br />Pardon?<br /><br />&gt;Could it be that a counter example has been made, which renders your <br />&gt;previous stance null and void? Why don't you admit that your previous stance <br />&gt;is incorrect? Or, if you somehow managed to slip up, and misstated your <br />&gt;origional stance, why not admit it?<br /><br />No.  Well, again I stated that a painless death isn't cruel, but I don't<br />think I stated that all painful executions *are* cruel.  I think that some<br />are cruel, depending on the nature and duration of the pain.<br /><br />&gt;By the way, how long is too long?<br /><br />Anything more than an instant, I guess.  Any death <span style=\"color: #4dac26; font-weight:bold;\">by</span> suffocation<br />asphyxiation, or blood loss would be cruel, I think (this includes the<br />gas chamber, and drawing and quartering).  I'd say that any pain that<br />lasts, say, over twenty seconds or so would be too long (but this may<br />be an arbitrary cutoff, I suppose).<br /><br />keith<br />", "exp": [["Host", -0.069706126164088861], ["Posting", -0.064427283812190525], ["writes", -0.055659531598562149], ["Re", -0.049372478038725603], ["NNTP", -0.042824350134715673], ["cco", -0.036154201646629414], ["Keith", -0.03252055943643508], ["California", -0.030022564912007801], ["Ryan", -0.030019085188956768], ["by", 0.0064339846691510274]]}, "id": 191, "true_class": 0}], "class_names": ["Atheism", "Christianity"]}
